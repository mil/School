        The problem of evil arises out of the fact that there is a sufficient amount of evil that would seem contradictory to co-exist with the classical theologians construal of God as being: omnipotent, omnibenevolent, and omniesencent. This omnipotent, omnibenevolent, and omniesecent God I will refer to as the 3 Os God. Very generally the problem of evil can be described as: why does evil exist? For the 3 Os God to be omnibenevolent it means that God is all good. The 3 Os God being omnipotent means that God is capable of doing anything imaginable (although <i>anything imaginable</i> will be expanded upon in the construction argument). Additionally, by the 3 Os God being omniesent, it is meant that God is all knowing. Given the the 3 components of the theologian's 3 Os, the problem arises how can evil exist with such a God? Numberouse arguments can be constructed in drawing out contradictions of the co-existence of the 3 Os God with evil such as: Why an omnibenevolant God continue to allow there to evil in the world since God's omnipotence could stop it? Why would an omnibenevolant God who is also all knowing create a world or even set into motion a world with evils?  The number of contradictions offered by the athesit arising out of the problem of evil are numerous and seemingly legitamite. A particullarly interesting objection to the problem of evil which I would like to focus on, arguing in favor of a 3 Os God, is <i>GG</i>: Evil is necessary for greater-good.  Proceeding I will focus on the use of GG to solve the problem of evil, expand on its implications and potential counter-argumentation the atheist may offer particullary one objection to GG dubbed as the omnipotence paradox, and finally show the vulnerabilities of the omnipotence paradox demonstrating that GG still stands.

        GG asserts:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>We are given free will.</li>
        <li>Out of free will arises evil</li>
        <li>Thus: Evil is necssary for greater good.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        The Greater Good argument asserts that evil is a by product of free-will. Additionally, only by way of the evil that arises from our free-will could greater goods occur. Thus our liberty and free-will, undoubtedly considered as an incredibly important virtue is what introduces evil into this world. Evil is a necessary compontent for higher-order goods. When a hijacked plane crashed into the world trade center on Septermber 11th, 2001 -- while thousands died resulting an even greater good arised from that tragic evil event. This greater good was that thousands of firefighers and policeman demonstrated the virtes of heroism in saving the live sof those caught in the rubble. Additionally an entire nation was united for days, weeks, and even years after the attack in murning. This sense of nationalism and heroism would have never been possible without that initial tragic event. If we lived in a world without evil then we would no nothing of greater goods -- in fact theories of virtue in general would be demolished. Some of the most impactfully signifigant goods in this world are borne out of moral ideals centrered around virtues. As such, religious often encourage donating to the poor, helping the unfortunate, and providing for the weak. If there were no poor, unfortunate, or weak what would this world be? What would our moral philosophies look like? It is hard to say but it seems as if there would not be much of any virtue because if there was not a contiuum providing a division between good and bad then there would be little purpose of life.

        J.L Mackes makes several objections to the Greater Good argument, however I will focus exclusivly on his use of the Omni-Potent paradox to belittle the Greater Good argument. Mackie does so by showing that the notion of human free-will, which faciliates greater good, is contradictory of the existence of an omni-potent god. Consider the following proof by reudctio:
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li>God is Omni-Potent</li>
        <li>If God is Omni-Potent, then God could control men's free-will</li>
        <li>From 1-2: God can control men's free-will</li>
        <li>Either freedom (free-will) is a virtue God values more than good or God cannot control men's free-will</li>
        <li>Freedom is <i>not</i> a virtue God values more than good</li>
        <li>From 4-5: God cannot control men's free-will (The Omni-Potent Paradox)</li>
      </ol>

      <p>
        By showing how both 3 &amp; (6) can be derived from assuming an omni-potent God, Mackie shows the notion of a omni-potent being to be problematic. The main question Mackie wishes to present is "can an omni-potent beinng make things which he cannot subsequently control?". Mackie also adds that this statement also leads to the question of "can an omnipotent being make rule swhich then bind himself?". Mackie views this paradox additionally as being generalizable to more instances as well. For example -- it could be said there is a "parallel Paradox of Soveriengty. Can a legal sovering make a law restricting its own future legistlateive power?". One possible solution to the Omni-Potent paradox which Mackie offers it that is valid to assert that God could have at one time existed but no longer exists. Another possiblity is to say that God does have true omni-potence but no inividuals have power to act invidiaul of God. There are several other possibilities to the problem which the Omni-Potent pardox introduces however, none of them can solve the problem without calling into question the notion of true omnipotence.
