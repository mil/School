        The problem of evil arises out of the fact that there is a great deal of evil in the would that would seem contradictory to co-exist with the classical theologians construal of God (3 Os God) as being: omnipotent (all powerful), omnibenevolent (wholy good), and omniesencent (all knowing). Given the assumed existence of the theologian's 3 Os God, the problem arises:  how can evil exist with such a God? The problem of evil can be hashed out as problematic for such a God in several ways such as: Why would an omnibenevolant God continue to allow there to evil in the world since if God were omnipotent and could stop said evil? Or, why would an omnibenevolant God who is also all knowing create a world or even set into motion a world with evils?  The number of contradictions offered by the atheist arising out of the problem of evil are numerous and seemingly legitamite. A particullarly interesting objection to the problem of evil which I would like to focus on, is known as the argument from Greater Good: Evil is necessary for greater-good.  Proceeding I will show the attempted use of the Greater Good argument to solve the problem of evil, how the Greater Good argument fails to resolve the problem of evil in light of the omnipotent pardox, and finally offer additionall argumentation in support of the omnipotent pardox by refuting potential counterarguments to the omnipotent paradox.
      </p>

      <p>
        Firstly I would like to provide to the fullest extent the rationale behind the greater good argument. Preecding is a proof examining the greater good argument:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>We are given free will.</li>
        <li>Out of free will arises evil.</li>
        <li>Thus: Evil is necssary for greater good.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        The Greater Good argument asserts that evil is a by product of free-will. Additionally, only by way of the evil that arises from our free-will could greater goods occur. Thus, our liberty and free-will, which is undoubtedly considered as an incredibly important virtue is what introduces evil into this world. Evil is a necessary compontent for higher-order goods. When a hijacked plane crashed into the world trade center on Septermber 11th, 2001 -- while thousands died as a result, an even greater good arised from that tragic evil event. This greater good was that thousands of firefighers and policeman demonstrated the virtes of heroism in saving the live innocent civilians trapped in the rubble. Additionally, an entire nation was united for days, weeks, and even years after the attack in mourning. This sense of nationalism and heroism would have never been possible without that initial tragic event. Furhter, are virtues such as nationalism and heroism not of the highest order of good in this world? If we lived in a world without evil then we would no nothing of greater goods or virtue. Some of the most impactfully signifigant goods in this world are borne out of moral ideals centrered around virtues. Religious organizations often encourage donating to the poor, helping the unfortunate, and providing for the weak. What would our moral philosophies look like without virtous life made possible by the existence of evils? It is hard to say but without a contiuum providing a division between good and bad there would be little purpose to life other then good. Essentially a world without evil would be a world without: need for morals, virtues, or greater goods. A world where we were all hedonists? No. Evils are necessary because they provide greater goods and virtue for our world.

      <p>
        J.L Mackes makes several objections to the Greater Good argument, however I will focus exclusivly on his use of the Omni-Potent paradox to belittle the Greater Good argument. Mackie employs the omni-potent paradox by showing that the notion of human free-will, which faciliates greater good, is contradictory of the existence of an omni-potent god. Consider the following proof by reudctio:
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li>God is Omni-Potent, Omni-Benevolant, and Omniescent</li>
        <li>If God is Omni-Potent then God could control man's free-will</li>
        <li>From 1-2: God can control man's free-will</li>
        <li>From 1&amp;3: Either freedom (free-will) is a virtue God values more than good or God cannot control men's free-will</li>
        <li>From 1: Freedom is <i>not</i> a virtue God values more than good</li>
        <li>From 4-5: God cannot control men's free-will (The Omni-Potent Paradox)</li>
      </ol>

      <p>
        By showing how both 3 &amp; (6) can be derived from assuming 3 Os God, Mackie shows the notion of a 3 Os God as being problematic. The main question Mackie presents is: "can an omni-potent beinng make things which he cannot subsequently control?". Mackie also adds that this statement also leads to the question of "can an omnipotent being make rule swhich then bind himself?". Mackie views this paradox additionally as being generalizable to more instances as well. For example -- it could be said there is a "parallel Paradox of Soveriengty. Can a legal sovering make a law restricting its own future legistlateive power?". One possible solution to the Omni-Potent paradox which Mackie offers it that is valid to assert that God could have at one time existed but no longer exists. Another possiblity is to say that God does have true omni-potence but no inividuals have power to act invidiaul of God. There are several other possibilities to the problem which the Omni-Potent pardox introduces however, none of them can solve the problem without calling into question the notion of true omnipotence.
      </p>

      <p>
        I agree with Mackie's Omni-Potent paradox and proceeding would like to address several potential counter-arguments which may try counter such argumentation. The strength of the Omni-Potent paradox lies in the notion that it is impossible to construe a omni-potence God without specifying some additional criteria. The notion of omni-potence in concurrence with 
        
        One potential reply to the Omni-Potent paradox would be to question the third premise, mainly: why is it valid to assume that freedom is not a virtue that God values more than good? To this objection I want to emphasize that the Omni-Potent pardox works to address the greater good argument mainly by way of holding that God is a 3 Os style God in that God is omni-benevolant. It would seem contradictory for an omni-benevolant God to value free-will over the good.
      </p>
      <p>
        A counter reply at this point may be to re-hash the greater good argument in terms of multiple orders of goods. Mackie emphasizes this intuiton as well prior to discussing the OmniPotent. While humans understand second order goods, such as herosim, which require evils, there may be third order goods such that only god can understand. Consequently, we could hold that the omni-benevolance that God employs is a good beyond the scope of human understanding. This idea is often re-inforced in common culture with popular phrases such as "God works in mysterious ways" or "God knows best". The problem with this notion of third order goods is that it is a view that requires a sense of faith. It is impossible to accept the premise that God acts virtous manner that we will never be able to understand, without accepting fideism. To the strong fideist, I simply do not have the proper deductive argumentation to reply. Such style fideism is incompatible with deduective argumentation and I need not to give a reply. Requiring faith can render any argument seemingly "valid" in light of signifigant counter-evidence.
      </p>

      <p>
        The omni-potent paradox may be cripped if you are willing to accept that at one time God existed and was a 3 Os style God but no longer exists. However, a theologian would like to provide a richer notion of God's existence, primarily that the 3 Os God exists and always will exist.  Another alternative style argumentaiton to diffuse the omni-potent paradox compliant with the theologian might be to insist that God exists outside of the limitaitons temporal order.  If one insists that God is not constrained by notions of time that would be comptabile with the existence of a 3 Os God. The reasoning from a theologian would likely be: an Omni-Potent God created us and the limitations of time, the 3 Os God exists and has always existsed. Eliminating the time aspect from the the construal of a 3 Os God seems to diminish the Omni-Potent paradox. To somebody that raises this objection I would want to emphasize that sepcifying God as existing independent of time is quite a leap of faith to take. Just like in the preivous example, contorting that God exists independent of time is an assumption that I am not willing to grant as it is an assumption that employs not deductive logical discourse but rather faith through fideism. 
      </p>

      <p>
        As we have seen with each counter-reply to the Omni-Potent paradox, we are reduced to argument in the scope of fideism. I am willing to grant that the omni-potent paradox is a problem that can be solving in a number of different ways by requiring a little faith.. however if we are concerned with truly logical deductive discourse the notion of a 3 Os God requiring evil due to free will is a solution that crumbles in light of the OmniPotent Paradox.
