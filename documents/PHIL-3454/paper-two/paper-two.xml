    <div id="title">Questioning Mackie's Paradox of Omnipotence</div>
    <div class="response">
      <p>
        The problem of evil arises out of the fact that there is a sufficient amount of evil in the world in light of the contorted existence of a God that is: omnipotent, omnibenevolent, and omniesencent. By omnibeneveolent it is meant that God is the epitomy of good and know alls the good in the world. By omnipotent it means that God is capable of doing anything imaginable by humans or anything beyond that realm. And by omniesent it is meant that God knows everything about the world, including knowledge of all of the evils that exist within the world. Given that God is omniscient, omnipotent, and omni-benevolent it would seem to not logically follows that God exists. Why would God continue to allow there to exist evil in the world? Why would God, being omnibenevolent, merely even allow any evil in the world?  One particular consequence of the problem of evil is that it seems as if evils arise from two places. Those evils which are inflicted on man-kind derived from nature and those inflicted on man-kind by members of humanity. My cocnern preceeding will be of the latter. Mainly, why is it that humans seem to cause incredible amount of suffering and evil to one another?

      <p>
        The Greater Good argument is a claim often contorted as reasoning behind evil arising from free-will. It seems that without free-will, virtue and "higher-order" good ceases to exist. Example of higher-order good are numerous but one concrete example to solidify the point is: On September 11th of 2001 a hijacked plane flew into the world trade center killing thousands of innocent people. It was a seemingly tragic atrocity caused entirely by the free-will of humans as a whole. However, what came out of it was one of the most beutifal demonstrations of what "higher-order" good is. Numerous firefighters and policeman acted in heroism in attempts to save innocent lives and days, weeks, and even years after the attack - there was a seeming wave of nationalism. This kind of greater and virtuous good could not have existed without the tragic event in the first place.

      <p>
        There are many facile objections to a greater good style counter to the free-will argument -- however, what seems the most intersting and challenging is: if God made men truly with free-will would this not contradict God's own omnipotence? If so, then that would naturally bring into question the futher  J Mackie coined this dilemma as the Paradox of Omnipotence. Generally stated the problem is: "can an omnipotent being makes rules which them bind himself?" Mackie wants to assert that if God were to create us with full capabilities of free-will then that would put us in a situation in which we would be capable of true free-will in the sense that not even God could control us. This seems a natural result of asserting the claim that God is omni-potent. Can a being that can do anything create a being that limits on that being's own omni-potence?

        Mackie presents an interesting dilemma with the Paradox of Omnipotentce, however he conflates free-will of humans beyond the scope that an omni-potent being would be able to create. Yes - if it is true that an omni-potent God could create humans with free-will that he could no longer control then it would be the case that the God in fact would cease to be omnipotent. Mackie digs deeper into this notion of an omnipontent being able to bind itself by drawing reference to the legal system

        However, at this point I think it is essential the way in which omnipotentence is meant. The meaning in which Mackie wants to use omnipotence is a universal omnipotence in the sense that there seems to be no scope as to what God's powers are. However, this is a matter we are unable to speculate on. Leaving aside traditional notions of monotheism, God could have had another God, and that God could have been created by another God and so on. As it is such, when I walk into my back yard, plant a tree, and watch it grow I am its God in a sense. However, the important distinction to make is -- to that tree I could be omni-potent, however not in the same sense the God that could have created our universe is omni-potent. Scope is the important distinciton to keep in mind. If it so turns out that say I am a mad scientist and I create a tree so powerful that it becomes conscious and kills me -- that is a totally feasible thing to have happen. I could have said to be an omnipotent God in that I created the tree and all it ever knew -- however I never claimed to be omniescent. This is where the God that created the world must differ. An omniescent God, regardless of if he has this property to create.
