        The problem of evil arises out of the fact that there is a suffiicient amount of evil in this world. Further, the fact that God is often construed as being omnipotent, omni-benevolant, and omni - it would seem illogical that this evil exists in this world. 

        THe problem of evil is simply that if God is purported to be omniotent, omniscient, and omnibenevolant as mainstream religions such as Christianity and Judiasm often construe God, then why does evil exist in this world? If a 3 Os God were to exist why would God allow there to be evil in the world. Would not an omnibenevolant God choose to create an a world with no evil over a world with evil?
