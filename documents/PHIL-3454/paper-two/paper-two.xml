      <p>
        The Problem of Evil arises out of the fact that the existence of evil in the world seem contradictory to co-exist with a 3 Os God in being: omnipotent (all powerful), omnibenevolent (wholy good), and omniesencent (all knowing). The Problem of Evil can be seen as problematic for the theist subscribing to a 3 Os God on several fronts including: Why would an omnibenevolant God continue to allow evil to exist in the world since if God were omnipotent, then God could stop said evil? Why would an omnibenevolant God who is also all knowing create a world or even set into motion a world with evils? The number of apparent contradictions for a 3 Os God arising out of the problem of evil are numerous and seemingly legitamite. A particullarly interesting objection to the Problem of Evil which I would like to focus on is known as the greater good argument (GG). <i>GG</i> attempts to solve the Problem of Evil by showing that: Evil is necessary for greater good.  Proceeding, I will how particularly <i>GG</i> can be used to solve the Problem of Evil, how the <i>GG</i> argument fails in its solution in light of the Omnipotent Pardox (<i>OP</i>), and finally offer additionall argumentation in support of OP by refuting potential counterarguments to <i>OP</i>.
      </p>

      <p>
        Firstly I will provide a reconstruction of the greater good argument which can be found in writings of numerous theist authors. My re-construction will focus primarily on argumentation provided by Gottfried Leibniz in <i>Theodicy: A Defense of Theism</i>. Leibniz presents <i>GG</i> as:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Man was given free will</li>
        <li>Out of free will arises evil</li>
        <li>Evil enables greater good</li>
        <li>Thus: (<i>GG</i>) Evil is a necssary component of greater good</li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        It it necssary at this point that I distinguish what exactly Leibniz means by greater good before I offer counter-argumentation. Greater goods are goods that arise out of virtuous action only enabled by evil. One example of a greater good would be that of the virtuos and wholy good actions seen in response to the tragic event of a hijacked plane crashing into the world trade center on Septermber 11th, 2001. While thousands died on that fateful day, as a result of that tragedy, an even greater good arise. This greater good was that thousands of firefighers and policeman demonstrated the virtes of heroism in saving the lives of innocent civilians trapped in the rubble. Additionally, an entire nation was united for days, weeks, and even years after the attack in mourning. This sense of nationalism and heroism would have never been possible without that initial tragic event. Although Leibniz's <i>GG</i> only implicitly assumes (by name) that greater goods are in fact <i>greater</i> or of <i>more signifigance</i> than normal or first-order goods, it is easy to formulate alternative accounts of <i>GG</i> which explicity state this. Regardless, the matter of wheter greater goods are in fact more valuable than ordinary goods is not essential for <i>GG</i>. As it is such, the value of greater goods are that they outweight the evils in the world needed to produce them. 
      </p>

      <p>
        The main objection I wish to present in the face of <i>GG</i> is that of a nasty side-effect introduced by premise (1), that: Man was given free will.  The effect which I speak of is the Omnipotent Paradox (OP) which is best construed by J.L. Mackie in <i>Evil and Omnipotence</i>. Consider the following reconstruction of Mackie's derivation of <i>OP</i>:
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li>God is Omni-Potent, Omni-Benevolant, and Omniescent</li>
        <li>If God is Omni-Potent then God can control man's free-will</li>
        <li>God can control man's free-will <i>[From 1-2]</i></li>
        <li>Either freedom (free-will) is a virtue God values more than good or God cannot control men's free-will <i>[From 1 &amp; 3]</i></li>
          <li>Freedom is <i>not</i> a virtue God values more than good <i>[From 1]</i></li>
        <li>Thus: God cannot control men's free-will <i>[From 4-5]</i></li>
      </ol>

      <p>
        Derived from the given assumption of (1) and the harmless additional assumption of (2), resulting: (3) and (6) arise as contradictory -- showing <i>OP</i>. The question the paradox presents us will with is: "can an omni-potent being make things which he cannot subsequently control?". Mackie also adds that <i>OP</i> naturally additionally leads to to the question of: "can an omnipotent being make rule which then bind himself?".
      </p>

      <p>
        When questioning <i>OP</i>, a first intution for the theist may be to question premise 3. Mainly the theist may ask the question of: is it safe to assume that God values good more than free will? In this vein, the theist  may  appeal to re-hash the greater good argument in terms of multiple orders of good. If it is such that the theist can re-hash <i>GG</i> such that the sense in which God is omnibenvevolant brings into question the soundness of premise 3, possibly <i>OP</i> could be avoided. To introduce an alternative interpretation of Omnibenevolance, the theist could assert that: while humans understand second order goods, such as herosim (which require evils), there may additionally be third order goods such that only God can understand why they are wholly good. Consequently, the theist could hold that the omnibenevolance that God employs is a third-order good beyond the scope of human understanding. This idea is often re-inforced in common culture with phrases such as "God works in mysterious ways" or "God knows best". 
      </p>
      <p>
        The problem with re-hashing <i>GG</i> in this way to avoid <i>OP</i> is that it is a solution that requires a great deal of of faith. The theist's wants to assert that: God's omnibenevolance is such that we will cannot understand it but somehow regardless of our incoherence of <i>why</i> evils exist, it is for the overarching greater good. I plainly do not see how a completly rational beign could accept this re-hash of GG. This style of reasoning requires siginifigant amounts of faith and is truly best deemed plainly as fideism. To the fideist, I simply do not have the proper deductive argumentation to reply. Irregardless I can show that this re-hash of <i>GG</i> cannot save the theist from the Problem of Evil. As it turns out, <i>OP</i> can be wrought out in presnece of a soley Omnipotent God just as easily as it can be wrought out in presence of a 3 Os God. Consider the following minimal proof which leads to <i>OP</i> assuming only a solely omnipotent God who is not omnibenevolant or omniescencent:
        </p>

      <ol>
        <li>God is Omni-Potent</li>
        <li>An Omnipotent God could command that: God himself could no longer control man</li>
        <li>Thus: It is possible that god is no longer omnipotent <i>[From 1-2]</i></li>
      </ol>

      <p>
        This minimal and more generalized derivation of <i>OP</i> shows the unavoidability of the paradox. So then what is it about the setup which leads to the paradox which the theist could possibly bring into question?  Well, if theist asserts that at one time God existed and was a 3 Os God however, now God no longer exists... then it looks like you are in the clear of <i>OP</i>.  However, a theist arguing for a 3 Os God surely would like to provide a richer notion of God's existence, primarily that the 3 Os God exists now and always will exist. Surely, the  thiest would not like to conceed that God is dead. This leads to an alternative counter-argument that the theist could offer playing on the temporal tie of <i>OP</i>, mainly: that God exists outside of the limitaitons temporal order.  If the theist insists that God is not constrained by notions of time, that would seem to cripple notion introduction of the <i>OP</i>. As such, God transcends time and thus we cannot understand God's omnipotence from our temporal notions. As such, we simply do not have the proper faculties to say wheter God could or could not perform some action that later impended on his omnipotence. Could God limit his own omnipotence at a later date than he was granted it (if he was so granted)? Well -- that style question the <i>OP</i> brings up cannot even be applied to a God existence indpendent of time.
      </p>

However, in this light I must emphasize, similariarly as I did with the last objection, that the root of the theist argumentation is that of blind faith. Contorting that God exists independent of time is an assumption that I am not willing to grant for a completly rational agent. Further, from a theologian's perspective this is not the way the 3 Os God is typically portrayed. 
      <p>
        Thus, I will grant that <i>if</i> the temporal aspect is elimiated from the the portrayl of a 3 Os God, then <i>OP</i> ceases to be a problem for the theist asserting <i>GG</i>. However, it seems except to avoid the problems introduced by <i>OP</i>, God existing indepdent of temporal order is not in line with the classical theologian's construal of a 3 Os God. So in order to show God's existence to transcend time the theist must either: accept the premise ad-hoc as to avoid <i>OP</i> or simply have faith that this is the case as to avoid <i>OP</i>. Either way seems insufficient but likely to this extent the theist would likely rather accept an argument from faith rather than an ad-hoc argument.  Thus, the theist is right back where he started when introduced to <i>OP</i>. As we have seen with each counter-reply to <i>OP</i>, the theist's reasoning must be reducing to a sense of fideism in each instance. I am surely willing to grant that <i>OP</i> is a problem for <i>GG</i> that can be solving numerous ways by requiring faith. I could go on all day listing ways in which the the theist might appeal to faith to dissolve <i>OP</i>, however, we are concerned with logical and deductive discourse. Further, if we are concerned with logical and deductive discourse <i>OP</i> can be seen resulting from <i>GG</i> or simply out of putting forth a soly omnipotent God. Regardless, as seen the only way to solve the <i>OP</i> for the theist is to require faith. However, in the logical discourse we are concerned with... I do not consider requiring faith to show God's existence to be an acceptable solution.
