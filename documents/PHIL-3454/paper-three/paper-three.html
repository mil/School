      Both Lois Hope Walker and Friedrich Neitzsche would agree that without God life is devoid of any "ultimate" value or purpose. However, where the two authors would disagree is the implications of there being no "ultimate" value to life as a result if there were no God. Consequently, Lois Hope Walker advocates theism; while Neitzche advocates atheism. Following, I will explore the difference in reationale for each author. In (I), I will give an account of why Neitzsche thinks that it is good that "God" does not exist. In (II), I will offer one of Louis Hope Walker's strongest objections to Neitzsche's view as expressed in (I). In (III), I will offer a reply that Neitzche would likely offer in response to Walker's refutation seen in (II). Finally, concluding in (IV), I will introduce a potentional counter-argument to Neitzche positive view for disbelief in God and explain why said counter-argumentation is unsatisfacotry to Neitzche's view.
      </p>

      <h2>I. Neitzsche: "God" Creates Value or You Create Value</h2>
      <p>
      Neitzche held that out of nihilism (the idea that life has no ultimate purpose or value) grows an interesting dillemma: accept "God" exists and creates the ultimate value of life <i>or</i> accept that God does not exists and thus you must deem your own ultimate value to life. Neitzche advocated accepting the latter over the former by arguing that humans are nautrally herd animals from a biological level. Further, "God" is merely an embodiment of herd instinct and thus to be a theist is to merely give into herd instict and suppress one's own individual value in sacrifice to the herd.
      </p>
      <p>
      Neitzche's reasoning works by positing that "God" and God's associated value system is merely an embodiment of herd-instinct observable in humans.  To explore this claim, we must first consider the sense in which Neitzche viewed humans as herd animals.  For herd animals, all moral choices in life are ultimatly guided to <i>support the herd</i>. Neitzche describes this phenomenon in a prose entitled <i>Herd instinct</i> as "wherever we encounter morality, we find an evaluation and ranking of human drives and actions. These evaluations and rankings are always the expression of the needs of a community and herd: that which benefits <i>it</i> the most... Morality is herd-insticnt in the individual".  To this additionally, Neitzche added that not only are moral choices guided to benefit of the herd, but futher that <i>every</i> choice in life can be seen as ultimatly a moral choice in regard to benefitting the herd. In a prose entitled <i>The Scope of Morality</i> Neitzche claims "As soon as we see a new picture, we immediatly construct it with the help of all the old experiences we have had depending on the degree of our honesty and justice. There are not experiences other than moral ones, not even in the realm of perception". Thus every action every human has ever taken can be viewed in the virtue or either supporting or not supporting the herd. 
      </p>
      <p>
      However, the reader may now wonder: how is God merely an embodiment of herd-morality? To this Neitzche would highlight that the values of traditional conceptions of God as seen in the Judeo-Chritisan sense of Morality (JCM) are a mere direct reflection of herd-morality.  In Judeo-Christian religions, God is set to be the ultimate judge of a man's character. Certain actions are deemed good in virtue of appealing to God's judgment while other actions are deemed as bad in regards to not adhering God's set of values. One virtue that is said to be of very high value in virtue within the JCM context is that of the notion of altruism. Altruism orders that we should place value on the well-being of others. We should care about the less fortunate, needy, or anybody who has less power in life than we do. Neitzche points out that the only reason why altriuism is valued highly within JCM is because it benefits the herd positivly most positlvy. Altruism gives the member of a herd an opportunity precisgly to serve as a <i>function</i> of the embodiment of the herd. As Neitzche puts it: "In many peple I see a suprlus stength and pleasure in wating to become a function; they press toward and have the most delicate sense for all places where precisely they can be a function".
      </p>

      <p>
      Neitzche's view that we should advocate herd-morality and thus belief in God is a bad thing because it suppreses the value of the individual. Basically the question Neitzche poses to the reader is: either herd-morality (God) creates life's value or you create your own life's value. If you choose the former over the latter you will simply be a function of the herd and loose any sense in which you may create your own value. Furthermore, a world with God is one where the indvidual may be punished, feel remorseful, and be subject to judgment at the vice of the welfare of the herd. For Neitzche, the world only has "good" and "evil" because we choose the see the world in terms of good and evil. The universe itself is value nuetreral and viewing the universe as an atheist frees ourselves such that we may be the judges of our own character, or simply not at all.  Values systems are a creation of man, and a shared value system (or belief in God), is a mere embodiment of the values of the herd-instict of humans.  As individuals we may nautrally value certain things: art, self-expression, indvidiuality, and so on. The indvidual free from God, is free to place value on whatever he wants or not at al. One interesting quote from Neitzche to this extent is: "the thinker sees his own actions as experiemtns and questions... to him success and failure are primarly answers. To be vexed or even to feel remose because something goes wrong - he leaves that to those who act because they were ordered to do so and who expect a beating when his gractious lordship is not pleased with the result".
      </p>

      <h2>II. Walker: Why We Should Accept Value Derived From God</h2>
      <p>
      I will now explore an argument for theism Lois Hope Walker offer in <i>Religions Gives Meaning to Life</i>. Walker's view directly conflicts with Neitzche's argument for why one should be an atheist.  Walker's argument for theism asserts that: freedom can only be understood in the context of having a goal or purpose to life. Furthermore, without a goal or purpose to life one can not ever be truely free. Thus, since religion gives us a purpose or meaning to life, we should accept the purpose of life and morals which religion gives us.
      </p>
      <p> 
      Walker presents here argument as: "to be free is to be able to do some act A, when you want to, in order to reach some goal G". While Neitzche asserts that freedom is derived from rejection of typical herd-instinct and denial of the existence of God, Walker points out that this type of freedom is not freedom at all because it deprives life from any purpose or goal. Without an overarching purpose to our life, we cannot be free because we do not know the fundamental meaning, value, or purpose of life. Without overaching moral standards, we cannot evaluate indvidual actions in regards to wether they are good or bad.  Relgion gives us purpose and meaning in being able to say when an action conforms to moral standards or does not conform to moral standards. Since religion guides us in providing what actions are good and which are bad we are free to seek out good actions and avoid bad actions.  As Walker puts it: "Since religion claims to offer us the truth about the world, and since having true beliefs is important in reaching one's goals, it follows that our autonomy is actually heighted in having the truth about the purpose of our lives".  
      </p>
            <h2>III. Neitzchian Replies to Walker: Telological Value is Arbitary Value</h2>
      <p>
      Walker's argument works by pointing out that without God, life's actions are devoid of freedom because they fail actions fail to conform to some higher purpose or goal.  To Walkers argument would assert that Walker begs the question in assuming that actions need to have a goal to have a purpose or value. Neitzche would question the assumption in wondering: why is it the case that actions need to conform to an overaching goal to have purpose? Why is value ultimatly derived from an overarching goal or set of morals and not from the indvidual actions themselves? Consider a capatalist who sets himself a goal of earning 1 milllion dollars in his lifetime. As such, every dollar the capatalist earns is valuable to the capatalist because it gets him that much closer to his goal of getting 1 million dollars total. But why is earning a proprotion of the 1 million dollars not valuable in and of itself?  Is getting half a million dollars not independently valueable of getting the 1 million dollars? What about $1? Is there not value  in earning just $1? Money regardless of how much you have is value, perhaps not even for its extrinsic value but for the actions you needed to take to get value. When a college student graduates and gets his first job, although it may be low-paying while he gets paid some money for his low paying job, he also gets work experience that will get him further in this world. 
      </p>

      <p>
      A second reply Neitzche might give to Walker is that if we were to assume that actions could only have their value in end goals, why are the end goals that God sets any better than goals that the man himself might set? Maybe, as an indvidual all you choose to value is cheesecake and any actions that get you closer to cheesecake conform to your virtues of being a cheese cake lover. Why is this set of values inferior to the values which God sets? To this line of intuition Walker would likely posit the values God sets are good and bad and possibly draw on theological grounds that JCM values are historically rooted to get the good. However to this Neitzche could question the theology which Walker might assert and further Walker would be unlikely to be able to provide any a priori "proof" for God's existence. Thus Walker's belief in God on teologilocal grounds would be reduced to an argument from pragmatic values. JCM values Walker would say are generally good in getting at the good and bad in the world and isn't that enough?
      </p>
      <p>
      To this, Neitzche would likely be unsatified.


      that if we accept the purpose of life which religion impgunes us with then "God is on our side in the battle". If God is on our side in the battle, moral abugiuity is reduced to a sense of good and evil and regardless of if there was no objective good and evil in the first place, it wouldn't matter ultimatly viewed from a biological level. As she puts it: "Eventually, the sun will engulf and destroy the Earth anyway". However, if you are theist and believe in religion you'll have won the game of life. You will have had a purpose in your life since religion assigned value to your life.
      </p>


      <p>
      Neitzche's reply to Walker would likely point out that no a priori "proof" of a "God" can be given and thus values which "God" assigns are merely a byproduct of herd morality. However, let us entertain for the moment that beleif in "God" does ultimatly give our life some purpose or value. Let's use Christianity as our model in this world in which belief in "God" is relevant. According to Christianity, if a man performs on a whole more good actions than evil actions in his life then he gets to go to heaven. In heaven the man is greeted with 17 virgins and eternal pleasure.
      </p>
      <p>
      Now, we need ask: where is the proof man goes to heaven. To this Walker might give a theological reason however no a priori proof that heaven exists would be possible to give. Regardless, this deffiency need not be deterimental to Walkers argument since God merely creates value for the individuals life. If the individual was a "good" christian, regardless of if there is a heaven, as explored earlier the individual will have said to have "won the game of life". So just in virtue of belief in God being valuable in saying that retrospectivly a human can be judged as good or bad, after death a man's life had <i>some</i> sort of value.
      </p>
      <p>
      What is the problem with this view? Neitzche would simply point out that "God" creating an ultimate value to life is absolutly no different that the indvidual creating some ultimate value to their life. Why is belief in the theist JCM God any different from fideistic belief in any other God? Or perhaps the individual merely view himself as God? If the indvidual view himself as God
      </p>
      
            <p>
      Another reply to Walker one might give is that of pointing out that religion only provides one set of ultimate or moral goals which are arbitrarily defined by society. If we disregard my first objection to Walker and consider that freedom's value in terms of indivudal actions is preuly derived from adherence to specific telological goals, we can now ask the question: why are the moral goals or values that religions gives us any better than goals we create ourselves? Why should we value the set of goals in terms of morality that religion gives us any higher than goals we may define on our own. If one were a Neitzchian they are free to create their own value wherever they see fit and can create moral standards or goals and then have freedom in pursuit of those goals. This freedom is no different than the fredom which a JCM sense of morality would give us.
      </p>

      <h2>IV. Counter-Objection to Neitzche: The Pragmatist of Theism</h2>
      <p>
      One counter-objection to the Neitzche's idea that we should create our own set of values is that if we create our own values we will all be nihilist and anarchistic. If we devalue those things traditionally valued in the tradition of JCM morality that the world will turn into an intellecutalist distopia that would not be a good place to live. Since there will be no common ground for us to agree upon, we will be in a constant "war" of value. One person saying that murder is right and another saying it is wrong would be compatible with a Neitzian sense of morality. This will ultimate lead to chaos and doom the planet and a world of intellectualists devaluing things traditonally valued would lead to chaos. 
      </p>

      <p>
      To this objection, I would emphasize that the only reason we would devaluae a world in where were all nihilist creating our own value systems is that traditional morality teaches us to intuit things in just this way.  Neitzche was not concerned with non-thinkers and appealing to "the herd".  Neitzche was coerned with the way things "ought" to be and he personally from his own persepctive valued inviduals and those who created a value system all their own. The majority of the population will reamin theist and Neitzche's philosophy was iteneded for social outcasts. His philosophy was intended for those who saw beyond the traditional value system which JCM has impugned us with. For Neitzche it was only the truth to question further.
