      Both Lois Hope Walker and Friedrich Neitzsche woudl agree that without God our life is devoid of any "ultimate" value or purpose. However, where the two authors would disagree is the implications of there being no "ultimate" value to life as a result if there were no God. Consequently, Lois Hope Walker advocates theism; while Neitzche advocates atheism. Following, I will explore the difference between the two authors reasoning for each of their views. In (I), I will give an account of why Neitzsche thinks that it is good that "God" does not exist. In (II), I will offer one of Louis Hope Walker's strongest objections to Neitzsche's view as expressed in (I). In (III), I will offer a reply that Neitzschewould likely offer in response to Walker's refutation. Concluding in (IV), I will offer additional counter-argumentation defending the view that there being no God and thus no intrinsic objective value to life is something that is in Neitzsche's <i>persepctive</i>.

      <h2>I. Neitzsche: Why The Value Which "God" Impgunes is Dangerous</h2>
      <p>
      In this section I will explore Neitzche's general line of reasoning for why the notion of "God" impgunes a dangerous set of values on humanity and thus there being no GOd is a "good" thing.  The sense in which I use "good" will be explored in (IV) when Neitzche's perspective on such matter is explored in depth. For now, however "good" will not be a critical part of my analysis and thus I will mainly focus on the results of "God" ultimatly ultimatly having no value. However, first and foremost before introducing Neitzche's argumentation for why the value which "God" impugunes is dangerous, it is critical to first specify the sense in which the term <i>God</i> is used. 
      </p>
      <p>
      The term "God" can have many interpretations. I will define "God" to be refered to from here on in asan objetive, universal superbeing who created the universe and subsequently has control to rule over the universe.  Following from this definition of "God", belief in "God can be viewed with propositional value.  A subject can believe that such a God either does exist or does not exist. Put another way, God's existence can be stated to be true or false.  This sense in which the term "God" is used is adherent with the notions of <i>theism</i> and <i>atheism</i> where a theist believe truely in God and an athesist believes fasely in God. This propositional view of belief in God is discordant with an agnostic or possibly even a simply spirtual rendition of God. An agnostic does not view God's existence to hold propositional value but rather does not even deem there to be a question that should be properly posed as: does God exist? The agnostic stance will not hold in my analysis as the notion in which I will view God simply covers the basic belief of God as view propositionally. Thus, assuming God is defined as aformention and to be viewed propositionally I may now introduce Neitzsche's argument.
      </p>
      <p>
      Neitzsche did not believe God existed and furthermore he viewed this as a good thing. His rationale in doing so is laregly forcused around an analysis of existing religions and the cultural implications derived from such implications. Following I will give an account of why Neitzsche mthought it was good that God did not exist in a bi-part fashion. Firstly, I will establish the sense in which "God" is meant in reference to the prompt. Furhter, secondly, I will explain why the sense in which "God" does not exist is a valuable thing for Neitzsche's perspective.

      In <i>The Gay Science</i> Nietzsche offers a critique of the Judeo-Chritistian sense of morality (JCM) derived from belief in God is impuged with an inconsistent set of morals.  Nietzsche never offer a straight proof of why the Juedo-Christian sense of morality pragmatically dangerous but rather presents his argument in the form of sets of poetic proses. Nietzsche's critique of JCM revolves around three major points.
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>1. JCM was derived from a set of inconsistent motives<li>
        2. JCM is harmful to humanity in suppressing eudamonia</li>
        3. JCM is life-denying for the average. Following, I will give a brief</li>
      </ol>
      <p>
      Neitzche's first criticism of JCM is that JCM has origins which have given way to a set of inconsistent motives. JCM owes its moral origins to Judiaism which came to life under Roman rule. During this time Jews were represented as 2nd class citziens and resultingly they devalued the power and the strength of the Romans. As a result of the Jews devaulaing the strength and power of the Romans, Jews saw themselves as morally superior to the Romans. This lead the Jews to embrace a flavour of altruisum in which the weak were valued positivly.  Thus, what we find is that the altruism found in JCM was derived from simply: spite!
