      Both Lois Hope Walker and Friedrich Neitzsche woudl agree that without God our life is devoid of any "ultimate" value or purpose. However, where the two authors would disagree is the implications of there being no "ultimate" value to life as a result if there were no God. Consequently, Lois Hope Walker advocates theism; while Neitzche advocates atheism. Following, I will explore the difference between the two authors reasoning for each of their views. In (I), I will give an account of why Neitzsche thinks that it is good that "God" does not exist. In (II), I will offer one of Louis Hope Walker's strongest objections to Neitzsche's view as expressed in (I). In (III), I will offer a reply that Neitzschewould likely offer in response to Walker's refutation. Concluding in (IV), I will offer additional counter-argumentation defending the view that there being no God and thus no intrinsic objective value to life is something that is in Neitzsche's <i>persepctive</i>.

      <h2>I. Neitzsche: Either "God" Creates Value or You Create Value</h2>
      <p>
      In this section I will explore the line of reasoning Neitzche employs in viewing that the lack of God's existence is a good thing.  Neitzsche never explicitly illustrates his "argument" for why belief in God is a bad thing, but rather presents his thoughts in series of poetic proses. As such, although I will represent my interpretation of Neitzche's sense of why it is a good thing that God does not exist, I cannot say for sure that this was "Neitzche's view". What I will represent is my mere intrepreation of one way Neitzche may have intended his work in the <i>Gay Science</i> to be taken. That said, I will now introduce the first component for why Neitzche thinks it is good that God does not exist.
      </p>

      <p>
      Neitzche viewed humans as being herd animals speaking from a biological level. For a herd animal, moral choices in life a human makes are ultimatly to <i>support the herd</i>. Neitzche describes this phenomenon in a prose entitled <i>Herd instinct</i> as "wherever we encounter morality, we find an evaluation and raning of human drives and actions. These evaluations and raning are always the expression of the needs of a community and herd: that which benefits <i>it</i> the most... Morality is herd-insticnt in the individual". 

      Furthermore, not only are just moral choices in benefit of the herd, but further, every choice in life for a human ultimatly boils down to a moral choice in reference to the herd. In a prose entitled "the scope of morality" Neitzche describes this as "As soon as we see a new pircture, we immediatly construct it with the help of all the old epxeriences we have had dpeneding on the degree of our honesty and justice. There are not experiences other than mora ones, not even in the realm of perception". Now that we consider all actions in life to ultiamtly be moral ones and driven by the pact, Neitzche offers that the Judeo-Christian Morality (JCM) and other religious renditions of God merely serve to give us shared context for which to view said herd morality.
      </p>
      <p>
      Reflectig upon God's sense of morality in the JCM context quickly reveals how all virtues are ultimatly derived from herd morality. For example, one virtue that is positivly valued in the JCM sense of morality is that of altruism. Where altruism is the notion that we should place value on the well-being of others. Living altruistically means we should care about the the less fortunate, homeless, or really anybody who has less than a specific individual does. However, the only reason why this is the case within the JCM context is that we are naturally impguned with this herd morality. JCM simply re-inforces the herd morality of human beings and encourages us to not question such origins of the morality any further. In lameman's terms, according to Neitzche, God and its associated religions simply give us generally good guidelines on how to appeal to the morality of the herd.  However, the reader may now be wondering: if humans are instinctually herd animals and furthermore the JCM rendition of God gives us generally good guidlines on how to appeal to our own sense of herd morality why is this a bad thing? Regardless of whether God "exists" or not, the sense in which the JCM tradition has portrayed God is generally good in that it gives us generally good guidelines on how to appeal to our own sense of the herd morality.
      </p>

      <p>
      According to Neitzche, the reason why this herd morality impguned by the JCM rendition of God is bad is because is suppresses one's own sense of individualism. The JCM moral traidition centered around an objective and shared "God" simply gives us generally good guidelines on assigning value to the herd, however it does not allow the individual to place value on themself. Further, if we are to seperate ourselves from the notion that there is an objective God that judges us on individual actions in regards to how each action benefits the herd, we are free to in a sense be our own "God" and value what ever we want.
      </p>

      <p>
      Opposed to assuming that there is a God that derives all objective value (as in the JCM traidition), if we assume there to be no God the invidual is free to place value on whatever they want. Specifically, the indivdual is free to value themself as an individual and create their own set of moral guidlines and values. In Neitzche's philosophy, the fact that there is no God and thus no values in this world (nihilism) is a good thing because it frees us and allows us to dervie our own sense of values in the world. As individuals we may nautrally value certain things: art, self-expression, indvidiuality, and so on. Without God we are free to place value on whatever we want. Furthermore, it is not a problem that everyone may have a different set of values since self-evaluation and one being the judge of one's own merit frees ourselves from external herd morality evaluation.
      </p>
      <h2>II. Walker: Why We Should Accept Value Derived From God</h2>
      <p>
      I will now explore one of Lois Hope Walker's objections she gives in <i>Religions Gives Meaning to Life</i> as to why Neitzche's rejection of belief in God and further viewing humans bound to herd morality has negative consequenecs.  The objection she offers to why one should accept the value that the JCM set of mroality gives us is that freedom can only be understood in the context of having a purpose. As Walker puts it: "to be free is to be able to do some act A, when you want to, in order to reach some goal G". Neitzche asserts that freedom is derived from rejection of typical herd-instinct  moral standards in acceptence of God. Walker points out that this freedom is not freedom at all because it derives life from any purpose or goal (G).
      </p>

      <p>
      According to Walker, without an overarching purose to our lives we are not free in a sense because any action need conform to an overaching purose. Without overarching purpose to our ives, we cannot be free because we do not know the fundamental meaning, value, or purpose of life. Relgion on the other hand gives us this purpose and meaning. As Walker puts it: "Since religion claims to offer us the truth about the world, and since having true beliefs is important in reaching one's goals, it follows that our autonomy is actually heighted in having the truth about the purpose of our lives".  Extending on the argument that religion gives meaining to our lives by defining a concrete goal to which we can conform our actions, Walker lists several positive side effects. One positive side effect is that "Good will win over evil". 
      </p>

      <p>
      In claiming that good will win over evil, Walker argues that if we accept the purpose of life which religion impgunes us with then "God is on our side in the battle". To elaborate on this claim she posits that moral abugiuity is reduced to a sense of good and evil and regardless of if there was no objective good and evil in the first place, it wouldn't matter ultimatly viewed from a biological level. As she puts it: "Eventually, the sun will engulf and destroy the Earth anyway". However, if yuo are theist and believe in religion you'll "win the game of life" since there is an ultimate purpose to life: goodness.
