      Both Lois Hope Walker and Friedrich Neitzsche woudl agree that without God our life is devoid of any "ultimate" value or purpose. However, where the two authors would disagree is the implications of there being no "ultimate" value to life as a result if there were no God. Consequently, Lois Hope Walker advocates theism; while Neitzche advocates atheism. Following, I will explore the difference between the two authors reasoning for each of their views. In (I), I will give an account of why Neitzsche thinks that it is good that "God" does not exist. In (II), I will offer one of Louis Hope Walker's strongest objections to Neitzsche's view as expressed in (I). In (III), I will offer a reply that Neitzschewould likely offer in response to Walker's refutation. Concluding in (IV), I will offer additional counter-argumentation defending the view that there being no God and thus no intrinsic objective value to life is something that is in Neitzsche's <i>persepctive</i>.

      <h2>I. Neitzsche: "God" Creates Value or The Self Create Value</h2>
      <p>
      In this section I will explore the line of reasoning Neitzche employs in viewing that the lack of God's existence is a good thing.  Neitzsche never explicitly illustrates his "argument" for why belief in God is a bad thing, but rather presents his thoughts in series of poetic proses. As such, although I will represent my interpretation of Neitzche's sense of why it is a good thing that God does not exist, I cannot say for sure that this was "Neitzche's view". What I will represent is my mere intrepreation of one way Neitzche may have intended his work in the <i>Gay Science</i> to be taken. That said, I will now introduce the first component for why Neitzche thinks it is good that God does not exist.

        Neitzche viewed humans as being herd animals speaking from a biological level. For a herd animal, moral choices in life a human makes are ultimatly to <i>support the herd</i>. Neitzche describes this phenomenon in a prose entitled <i>Herd instinct</i> as "wherever we encounter morality, we find an evaluation and raning of human drives and actions. These evaluations and raning are always the expression of the needs of a community and herd: that which benefits <i>it</i> the most... Morality is herd-insticnt in the individual". 
        
        Furthermore, not only are just moral choices in benefit of the herd, but further, every choice in life for a human ultimatly boils down to a moral choice in reference to the herd. In a prose entitled "the scope of morality" Neitzche describes this as "As soon as we see a new pircture, we immediatly construct it with the help of all the old epxeriences we have had dpeneding on the degree of our honesty and justice. There are not experiences other than mora ones, not even in the realm of perception". Now that we consider all actions in life to ultiamtly be moral ones and driven by the pact, Neitzche offers that the Judeo-Christian Morality (JCM) and other religious renditions of God merely serve to give us shared context for which to view said herd morality.
        </p>
        <p>
          Reflectig upon God's sense of morality in the JCM context quickly reveals how all virtues are ultimatly derived from herd morality. For example, one virtue that is positivly valued in the JCM sense of morality is that of altruism. Where altruism is the notion that we should place value on the well-being of others. Living altruistically means we should care about the the less fortunate, homeless, or really anybody who has less than a specific individual does. However, the only reason why this is the case within the JCM context is that we are naturally impguned with this herd morality. JCM simply re-inforces the herd morality of human beings abd encourages us to not question such origins of the morality any further.
