Midterm Study Guide
===================
Boyle
-----
- **Mechanism/Corpuscularianism**
    * **Basics**:
        - Consists of **two principles**:
            * **Matter**
                - Size, Shape, Orientation
            * **Motion**
                - Can break up, impart motion onto other bodies
        - **Local Motion**: All changes ultimatly are the result of **change of place**
        - **Corpuscularian**: Avoid question of existence of atoms (indivisible bodies)
        - Believed **God was cause**:
            * Arranged matter
            * **Imparted motion to matter**
            * Established **"rules of motion"** (laws of nature)
    * **Supporting Explanation**:
        - "Intelligbleness or **clearness of mechanical principles** and explanations"
            * Everything can be broken down into **smaller bits**
        - Principles **fundamental chronologically and conceptually**
            * **Chronologically**: Universe couldn't begin without both matter & motion
            * **Conceptually**: Both matter and motion are irreduicble simple concepts
        - **Universiality/Comprehensive** (Infinite Divisibility)
            * Everything can be explained in terms of matter and motion
            * It is **universally generalizable**
            * Rock -> Pebble -> Some Small visible particle -> Some non-observable particle 
-  **Epicurean Theory** (Opponent Theory)
    * **Atoms swerving** in the **void**
    * **Atoms are the fundamental unit** of the **universe**
    * These **atoms hit one another** 
        - **Accidentally produce** all **phenomenon in universe**
    * Addresses question of how are matter and motion related to the universe as a system
    * Why can we explain everything in matter and motion? What we cannot explain...
- Main **Objection to Mechanist View**
    - **Chemical systems** can **explain principles differently from mechanical laws**
    - Chemists can **appeal to composite substances** and their principles
    - Different **elements have different proprites**
    - Some create fire, some boil at a certain tempreature, others have properties
        * Sulfure, Mecurcyr, Salt, etc.....
    * **Reply:**
        - These are **not fundamental** and satisfactory explanations
        - These **chemical reactions** can be **broken down into the Corpuscularian view**
            * These reactions are **results of matter being changed by motion**
        - **Chemical systems** can be explained in terms of **matter/motion**

Leibniz
-------
- **Rationalist** : Our knowledge is defined from innate ideas 
- **Axiomatic Method**
    * Definitions / **Axioms**
        - Have **no prior justifications**
        - **Givens** -- assumed to be true
            * A = A
            * A != ~A
    * **Rules of Inference**
    * Draw **Conclusions**
- **Primary Truths**
    * Follow the **Axiomatic Method**
        - **A Priori**
            * "From the **Earlier**"
            * **Independent of Experience**
            * Independent of Emperical Givens
    * Examples of Leibniz's **Axiomatic Truths**
        - **Indentity of Indescrinibles**
            * Ther **cannot** be **two** individual **substance** that **differ only in number**
            * They must **differ atleast in one property**
        - **Principle of Individuation** (Principle of Sufficient Reason)
            * Every Substance has a **principle**
            * This principle **distinguishes it from every other thing**
        - Principle of **Sufficient Reason**
            * **Nothing exists without a reason**
        - **Principle of Causality**
            * Every **effect must have a cause**
- **Necessary versus Contingent** Truths
    * **Necessary Truths**
        - Truths which are **Primary**
        - **Inference from Primary Truths**
        - Do **NOT** reference any **emperical givens**
        - **True in all possible worlds**
    * **Contingent Truths**
        - Truths which **depdend on emprical givens**
        - **True in this world** but **false in another**

- **Senses are Necessary** but **not Sufficient** for **Knowledge of the Truth**
    * Senses can only provide **instances**
    * **Instances cannot lead us to the truth**
        - We cannot say what has happend now will always happen (P. Induction)
    * While **senses are necessary** they are **not sufficient** for knowledge
        - Senses can only provide us with **contigent knowledge**
        - Only reason (and primary truths) can provide necessary truths

- **Pre-Established Harmony**
    * **Every substance** is created **not separate** from rest of the **world**
    * There is an **underlying unity**.
    * It's **internal principles reflect everything that goes on outside of the world**
    * Every **substance contains principles of what it is**
        - Thus every **substance contains principles of everything it is not**
    * This adheres to the primary truths outlined earlier
        
Locke
-----
- **Empericism**: Knowledge is based purely on experience
- **Philosophical Method** (3 Parts)
    1. **Analyze ideas in the conscious mind**
        - Subsequently notice that **origin is not physical**
        - Quote:
            * "Inquire into the origin of those ideas... which a man observes and is consious to himself he has in mind" (317). Notice that this "origin" cannot be a phsyical origin, that is, this is not empirical psychology (see above)
    2. Understand **what knowledge is derivable** from those ideas
        - What can our knowledge of those ideas provide
        - Quote:
            * "Inquire what knowledge th understanding has by those ideas, and the certainty, evidence, and extent of it" (317)
    3. Determine **nature and grounding of faith and opinion**
        - How can we ground any knowledge, etc.
        - Quote:
            * "Make some inquiry into the nature and ground of faith and opinion" (317)
- **Tabula Rasa**
    * There are **no innate ideas**
    * Our mind begins as a **blank slate**
    * We subsequently form ideas based on our **perception**

- Objections to Locke's Emepricism (Tabula Rasa)
    * **Innate Ideas**
        - **Argument**: It is possible to **attain knowledge w/o appealing to innate ideas
        - **Reply**: If we have **innate senses why would we need innate ideas**
            * For example -- we can have **sight and power to "recieve" color information**
            * This kind of information **exists independent of any "innate ideas"**
            * **The senses provide the whole of these ideas**
    * **General Assent**
        - **Argument**: **People assent "universal"** to all sorts of principles/ideas
            * **Widespread agreement** on such principles
            * This wouldn't be the case if we were randomly acquiring information
        - **Reply**:
            * **The world is the same world for everyone**
            * It is no suprise we agree
            * There are **no true universal arguments**
                - Look to **other cultures** for instance
    * **Age of Reason**
        - **Argument**: There is such thing as the **"age of reason"**
            * **Children attain knowledge of innate ideas**
            * **Mathematical proofs, identity of indescrinbiles A=A , A!=~A**
        - **Response**:
            * Even if there is widespread "reason", **need to acquire "innate truths"**
            * **Reason** alone **cannot** make these **inferences***
            * **Senses are the starting point**
            * **Reason** only provides the facultires to **go from one deduction to the next**

Locke versus Leibniz
--------------------
- **Leibniz's Reflection versus Hume's Reflection**
    * **Locke's Reflection**:
        - We have **certain senses** that form ideas **within our minds**
        - We then **reflect on those ideas to form new ideas**
        - These  reflection on ideas originate in our mind
            * But are originally cuased by the senses
        - Reflection is a **tool** to **evaluate emprical givens**
    * **Leibniz's Reflection**
        - Like Locke, **reflect on experience from senses**
        - Reflection gets us to truths about ourselves by way of reason
        - **Reason/Reflection** yeilds **truth about reality/being**
        - **Discernable difference** is what **reflection/reason** gives us **access to**
