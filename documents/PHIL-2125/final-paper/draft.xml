    <div id="title">Why Accept Lcoke's Empericism over Leibniz's Rationalism</div>
    <div class="response">
      <p><b>(A)</b> I will present the philosophical debate between Locke's empiricism and Leibniz's rationalism. An important consequence of the empiricism versus rationalism debate is the matter of:  <b>Which is the better inference to the best explanation as it will likely not be debated that the rationalism versus empiricism dilemma is best solved by an inference to the best explanation. Taking an I.B.E route, Locke's empiricism, not assuming innate necessary truths, seems a far less assumption-laden hypothesis and further we can positivly assert that atleast some knowledge is derived from experience -- however, we cannot safely assert that atleast some knowledge is innate.</b>
      </p>

      <p><b>(B)</b> Leibniz's Rationalist Argument:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>The senses can only ever give us knowledge of singular experiences.</li>
        <li>We will never be able to observe all instances of any one thing.</li>
        <li>The instances we've observed of a particular thing can not be said to be always generalizable (instances cannot prove logical necessity).</li>
        <li>Thus: The senses are only able to provide us with contingent knowledge of the world but not necessary knowledge.</li>
      </ol>

      <p><b>(C)</b> Locke's Empericist Argument</p>
      <ol>
        <li>It is possible to attain knowledge without appealing to innate ideas.</li>
        <li>Even ideas deemed innate by rationalists such as Leibniz's primary truths must be discovered by way of experience.</li>
        <li>Thus: There are no innate truths. All knowledge is derived from experience</li>
      </ol>

      <p>
        <b>(D)</b> The rationalist versus empericist argument matters because it defines the fundamental model for how we view knowledge. Locke's argument seems stronger than Leibniz's argument in this regard to the notion that such dilemma is naturally prone to reduce to an inference to the best explanation style problem. While Leibniz wants to say that we have innate knowledge and the senses are innadequte for necessary truths, this is seemily not a claim that has the possibility of being well grounded. How can we prove such innate ideas indepdent of expierence? Isolate a human from its culture, society, or enviroment? Even so, we would never be able to determine if these innate ideas do infact exist independent of experience because we cannot isolate a human from experience all together. Leibniz wants to philosophize on the notion of necassary truths, such as those seen in mathematical equations and such. However, who are we to say these truths did not originate from one's experience? We are incappable of seperating from experience - thus how can we hold responsible anything in isolation of experience?
      </p>

      <p>
        The more logical and simpler inference to the best explanation in rationalism versus empericism is to ride the emperical rollercoaster. While the same skeptical critisism of not knowing where infact our knowledge is derived from -- we can atleast say that <i>some</i> knowledge must be derived from experience. Such if someone grows up in a different culture they may have a very different accounts of particular things. This seems as a strong kind of inference and thus a safer route to head down in the empericist versus rationalist debate.
