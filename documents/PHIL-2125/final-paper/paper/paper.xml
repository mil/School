    <div id="title">Rationalism, Empericism, and Epistemelogical Perspectivism</div>
    <div class="response">
      <p>
        In this paper I will present the philosophical debate of empericism versus rationalism to be of little value to the epistemelogical persepectivist. I will develop this view through firstly looking at one of Leibniz's rationalism arguments claiming that the senses can only ever provide us with contigent emperical knowledge in (I). Nextly, I will reconstruct one of Locke's emperical arguments claiming that even seemingly innate or rational truths are emperically grounded in (II). Then, with these two arguments from the rationalist and empericists camps developed, I will present my own notion of what it is to be an epistemological persepctivist in (III). In (IV), I will reveal myself to be an epistemological persepectivist and further use this view to show why there is no winner and why I would not care about a winner of a philosophical debate between Locke's empericism and Leibniz's rationalism. Finally, in closing, I will offer additional insight into the nature of epistemological persepctivism.

      <h2>I. Leibniz's Rationalist Argument</h2>

      <p>
        In Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz's <i>New Essays on Human Understanding</i>, Leibniz offers a critical argument for why the senses are inadequete to provide necessary truths. Leibniz feels that because the cause-and-effect relations employed in deriving from experience cannot themselves be explained a priori, emperical knowledge cannot provide us with necessary truths. What this means is that each time we deduce a piece of knowledge from experience, we are only able to deduce this knowledge though noticing the recurrence of singular instances. For example, each morening we watch the sun rise and as a result we deduce that the sun will rise tomorrow morning. However, a priori (or before any original occurence of the event of the sun rising), it would seem ludacris to assert that the sun would rise. If we had never in our lives seen the sun rise we would have no reason to believe the sun would rise. Thus, our emperical knowledge is grounded purely in singular expereinces which seem un-generalizable. Consider the following formalized reconstruction of Leibniz's argument:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>The senses can only ever give us knowledge of singular or instances of experiences.</li>
        <li>We will never be able to observe all instances of any one thing.</li>
        <li>The instances we've observed of a particular thing can not be said to be always generalizable (instances cannot provide logical necessity).</li>
        <li>Thus: The senses are only able to provide us with contingent knowledge of the world but not necessary knowledge.</li>
      </ol>

      <p>
        It is important for Leibniz to state that experiental knowledge is contigent so far as he wishes to contrast such emperical knowledge with rational truths. Leibniz feels that rational truths, unlike emperical truths, are necessarily truth. Examples of such primary truths, as he calls them, are logical and mathematical proofs. These necessary truths Leibniz asserts stand independent of experience. If you consider the logical assumptions: 1. A &amp; 2. A->B. Independent of any experience, we can use purely deductive reasoning to infer from the given premises that B must necessarily follow. This knowledge is necessary and does not rest upon singular experiential instances. Necssary rational truths are purer in a sense than contigent truths in this such sense.
      </p>

      <h2>II. Locke's Empericist Argument</h2>

      <p>In John Locke's, <i>An Essay Concerning Human Understanding</i>,  Locke develops the view that all knowledge is derived from experience. Unlike Leibniz and other rationalists, Locke claims that there are no innate ideas and rather that at birth the mind is tabula rosa (a blank slate). One supporting argument Locke employs in his argumentation is that even if reason plays a part in the discovery of some knowledge, that does not prove that the knowledge is itself innate. Consider my following reconstruction of Locke argumentation in this vein (Locke, 320):</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Principles which can be said to be known through reason are only innate so far as reasoning itself is innate</li>
        <li>Reasoning itself is "nothing else but the faculting of deducing unknown truths from principles or propositions that are already known" (Locke, 320).</li>
        <li>From 1-2: Until reasoning is employed, any princple cannot be known</li>
        <li>Thus: "Innate" knowledge derived from reason is grounded in experience.</li>
      </ol>

      <p>
        Locke's argument works by pointing out that even if some knowledge were "innate" we would only be able to be realize this knowledge through experience. It may be that there are some fundamental principles we are impugned with at birth that we prima facie "know". However, it would be impossible to ever know that we know these principles without detatching ourselves from experience all together. In order to realize "innate" principles, first we have to employ reason in the deduction of such principles. Further, reasoning is fundamentally an emperically grounded process. To reason, you must be using the senses and experience to make sense of any reasoning. Reasoning cannot exist without experience.
      </p>

      <h2>III. Epistemological Persepctivism</h2>
      <p>
        Epistemological persepcitvisim is the view that propositional knowledge is purely of perspective nature and only of personal value for any given subject. An epistemological persepctivist (or <i>EP</i>) is soley concerned epistemologically with determining when, why, or how they themselves can be said to know some proposition, <i>p</i>. However, an <i>EP</i> is not concerned with knowing when, how, or why some external subject, <i>S</i> may claim to know that <i>p</i>. If one were to embark on this later inquiry, it would assume by its context that knowledge is an objective construct and something we could all agree upon. An EP doesn't care we cannot all agree upon knowledge. For an <i>EP</i>, any S knowing that p is a matter of concern for S's subjetive persepctive and S's subjective persepctive only.
      </p>

      <p>
        An <i>EP</i> refuse to care about why others subjects may claim to know that p because fundamentally the EP holds that knowledge is subjective and persepctive. Additionally, even when an external subject S claims to know that p, the EP's question of whether S <i>actually knows</i> that p boils down to: how do I know that S knows that p. And, herein lies the fundamentall problem with the empericism-versus-rationalism debate for an EP. An EP will only care about the empericism-versus-rationalism debate if it has some affect on his own theory of what it is to know. If the EP does not care about whether rationalism or empericism is of more epistemologial worth or the fails to care about "origin of knowledge", well then the EP simply views the empericism versus rationalism debate as a bunch of epistemological persepctivists failing to realize that they themselves are epistemoloigcial persepctivists. An EP may chose to care about knowing about others knowledge, however contarrily an EP could just as easily chose to not care about knowing about others knowledge. An EP cares about their sole persepctive knowledge first and past that is open to interpreation.
      </p>

      <p>
        And herein lies a great benefit to adopting epistemological persepctivism: if you are an EP, you simply view everybody else just as an EP.  Of course, an individual may hold that maybe rationalism is more fundamental than empericism in the origins of knowledge or visa-versa. However, for the EP these views are nothing more than epistemological persepectives. Is there one right objective answer: likely not. Further, if you embrace that you simply don't care if there is an objective answer, well then, you'll give a flat no. Your fellow EPs may argue all day and night about whether expiereince rests on rationale or the contrary, however, the EP simply does not care so far as it does not affect his persepctive view of knowledge.  At this point, the empericist or rationalist will likely assert: "This idea of an epistemological persepctivist is absurd! And furthermore, I don't consider myself one!". To this, I can offer little further argumentation but simply point out again that any subject S refusing to be labeled as a EP does not prevent any other EP from viewing S as a fellow EP. I will concede that an empericist or a rationalist doesn't have to consider themselves an EP, however, this will not stop any other EP from considering themselves and indeed anyone who has ever argued as a rationalist or empericst to be merely a fellow EP. 
      </p>

      <h2>IV. I am a Epistemological Persepctivist</h2>
      <p>
        Now, with EP developed it seems obvious why the philsophical debate of Locke's empericism versus Leibniz's rationalism doesnt matter: I am an EP! In fact, I am the kind of EP that is along the lines of the hardest-core EPs. I think all knowledge is completly subjective and persepctive. I don't think there is any objective knowledge and I really don't care about theories of knowledge empericists and rationalists develop. It would be impossible for any rationalist or empericist to say a certain type of knowledge is truly indenpent of the other because they are inherently indivisble forces. As seen in Locke's aregumentation: to undertsnad ratinalism you must employ empericism. Leibniz gives similar arguments in many cases of how to understand empericism you must employ rationalism. And, this is the essential problem motivinating my epsitemological perseptive. Rationalist and empericsits will argue all day about which is the "origin of knowledge" or more fundamental. However, so far as we can't detach ourselves from experieence or reason it will be impossible to say which one is more essential to knowledge. This co-dependence between rationale and experience is a major roadblock for viewing either as "better". Neither is better and rationalism versus empericism is an unsolvable philsophical debate, horay! The best we can do at this point is resepect that these empicisim and rationalism are persepctives we are talking about. Nothing more, and nothing less.
      </p>

      <p>
        In closing I will make one final note to progress how we should view epistemological persepcitivism. Epistemological persepcitivism is largely akin to agnostic theories seen in religion. While an an inividual may be an agnostic in terms of religion, they may lead a deeply spiritual life. In fact, an agnostic is free to make their own deeply spiritual religion by combining the best components of all existing religions.  In a similar vein, an EP holds there to be no objective answer to the empericism versus rationalism debate, however, that does not stop the EP from holding some theory of knowledge to be of higher worth than some other theory of knowledge. There can be the emperical-advocate EP, the rationalist-advocate EP, the pragmatic EP, or even the anarchist EP. EPs come in all shapes and sizes and anyone who is an EP views everyone else to be an EP. The EP will recognize empericist and rationalism persepctives are just that: <i>persepectives</i>. You should care deeply about your own persepective and little about others. So far as you've got your subjective persepctive theories on what you can know, why should you care any more? For a certain kind of EP, they may value the empericism versus rationalism debate higher than I do. However, for the sense in which I am an EP, since we cannot detach ourselves frome xperience or rationale it seems silly to say that Locke's or Leibniz "wins"! Thus, in my own hard-core rending of being an EP, the empericism versus rationalism debate does not matter.
