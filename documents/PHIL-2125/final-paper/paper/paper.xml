    <div id="title">Why the Empericism versus Rationalist Debate Doesn't Matter to the Epistemelogical Pragmatist</div>
    <div class="response">
      <p>
        In this paper I will present the philosophical debate of empericism versus rationalism to be of little value in terms of knowledge to the epistemelogical pragmatist. I develop this view through first looking at one of Leibniz's rationalism argument claiming that there are truths which may exist independent of experience. Nextly, I will reconstruct one of Locke's emperical arguments that even seemingly innate or rational truths are emperically grounded. With two arguments from the rationalist and empericists camps developed, I will present my own argumentation for why both Locke's empericist view and Leibniz's rational viewpoint fail to provide any insight to the epistemological pragmastist. And finally, in conclusion, I will refute potentional counter-argumentation which would likely be argued against my view by the rationalist or empericst who thinks that the debate itself does matter.

      <p><b>(B)</b> Leibniz's Rationalist Argument:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>The senses can only ever give us knowledge of singular or instances of experiences.</li>
        <li>We will never be able to observe all instances of any one thing.</li>
        <li>The instances we've observed of a particular thing can not be said to be always generalizable (instances cannot provide logical necessity).</li>
        <li>Thus: The senses are only able to provide us with contingent knowledge of the world but not necessary knowledge.</li>
      </ol>

      <p>In John Locke's, <i>An Essay Concerning Human Understanding</i>,  Locke develops the view that all knowledge is derived frome experience. Unlike Leibniz and other rationalists, Locke claims that there are no innate ideas and rather that at birth the mind is tabula rosa (a blank slate). One supporting argument, Locke employs in his argumentation is that even if reason plays a part in the discovery of some knowledge, that does not prove that the knowledge is innate. Consider the following reconstruction of Locke argumentation in this vein (Locke, 320):</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Principles which can be said to be known through reason are only innate so far as reasoning itself is innate</li>
        <li>Reasoning itself is "nothing else but the faculting of deducing unknown truths from principles or propositions that are already known" (Locke, 320).</li>
        <li>From 1-3: Until reasoning is employed, any princple cannot be known</li>
        <li>Thus: Knowledge derived from reason has its grounding in experience.</li>
      </ol>

      <p>
        Locke argument works by pointing out that even if some knowledge were "innate" we would only be able to be realize this knowledge through experience. It may be that there are some fundamental principles we are impugned with at birth that we prima facie "know". However, it would be impossible to ever know that we know these principles. This is because in order to analyze these principles and derive knowledge from supposed "inante" principles, first we would have to employ reason in the deduction of such principles. Further, reasoning is fundamentally an emperically grounded process.  In this sense, Locke's argument is quite strong. In order to disprove Locke's position we would need to be able to understand reasoning from a detatched model of consiousness. Simply viewing reason as independent source of knowledge is impossible as claimed "innate" principles may only be recognize through the use of the emperical process of reason itself.
      </p>

      <p>
        Epistemological perspectivism is the view that propositional knowledge is purely of perspective nature for any given subject. An epistemological persepctivist (or <i>EP</i>) is concerned with determining when they themselves can be said to know some proposition, <i>p</i>. However, an <i>EP</i> is not concerned with knowing when some external subject, <i>S</i>, knows that <i>p</i>. This later question, assumes by its context that knowledge is an objective construct. For an EP, S's knowing that p is a matter of concern for S and S only.
      </p>

      <p>
        If an EP had to choose a winner of the rationalism versus empericism debate, the EP would likely concede that Locke's emperical argumentation is more compatabile with empistemological perspectivism than rationalism. Locke's argument that we cannot understand rationale independent of the experience is valid and fits within a persepctivist view. However, to this extent the EP would note that making the rationalism-empericism division is not of philosophical value.  For the EP, one's pespective is the combination of both rationalist and empericist argumentation and seperation in deducing which is "primary" in the value of epistemology is ludacris. The fundamental problem the EP would have with both rationalism and empercisim is that both supervene on eachother. When a rationalist says that a matehmatical proof is true indepnednt of experience, they may only say this because they themselves have used experience to deduce so. Thus, in this case empericism supervenes on rationalism. Contrarily, when the empericst says that all knowledge is derived from experience they must concede that they are only able to make such deductions through rationale. Thus, rationalism supervenes on empericism.
      </p>

      <p>
        Now the question the EP is left with is: does empericism supervene more on rationalism or does rationalism supervene more on empericsim. This question sounds rediculous at face value and in fact it is! Trying to seperate rationalism and empercisism from one another to show that one is of more epistemological value or could even stand independnt of the other would be only the working of a madman EP.
      </p>

      <p>
        At this point, an empericist or a rationalist arguing against EP might assert that this leves epistemology with a very vague notion of what it is to "know". Further, that a richer notion of "knowledge" must be ascertainable and we should be concerned with knowing when a subject knows that p. Even if the EP were to grant that meta-knowledge (knowledge about others knowledge that p) or simply objective knowledge were a valid project it would have to take place in the context of persepctivism. When us epistemologists go to merry lane and try to analyze and deduce about the nature of knowledge we should be thinking primarly about... scope. Empistemological persepectivism holds that all knowledge is in persepective to its subject. Up until now, we've assumed that the subject is a single human knower. However, if we change the subject to be <i>human</i> knowledge in a broader sense, then we have a different project all together.
      </p>

      <p>
        What if we rephrase the rationalism versus empericism debate in the context of objective knowledge derived from epistemological persepectivism? Does the rationalism-empericism divide further our knowledge any more? I think not. We are faced with again the same problem we were faced with at the invidiaul subject level. Both reationalism and empericism supervene on eacher. They are inseperatable forces. Furthermore, for this, we must concede: the empericism versus rationalism debate does not matter.
