    <div class="response">
      <p>
        In this paper I will present the philosophical debate of empericism versus rationalism to be of little value to the epistemelogical persepectivist. I will develop this view through firstly looking at one of Leibniz's rationalism arguments claiming that the senses can only ever provide us with contigent emperical knowledge. Nextly, I will reconstruct one of Locke's emperical arguments claiming that even seemingly innate or rational truths are emperically grounded. Then, with these two arguments from the rationalist and empericists camps developed, I will present my own notion of what it is to be an epistemological persepctivist. Further, I will elabtorate why the empericist versus rationalist debate fails to provide any insight to the epistemological persepcticst. In closing, I will show why for the empistemological persepctivsist the rationalist versus empericism debate yields only un-necessary argumenation with no clear solution.
      </p>

      <p>
        In Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz's <i>New Essays on Human Understanding</i>, Leibniz offers a critical argument for why the senses are inadequete to provide necessary truths. Leibniz feels that because the cause-and-effect relations employed in deriving from experience cannot themselves be explained a priori, emperical knowledge cannot provide us with necessary truths. What this means is that each time we deduce a piece of knowledge from experience, we are only able to deduce this knowledge though noticing the recurrence of singular instances. For example, each morening we watch the sun rise and as a result we deduce that the sun will rise tomorrow morning. However, a priori (or before any original occurence of the event of the sun rising), it would seem ludacris to assert that the sun would rise. If we had never in our lives seen the sun rise we would have no reason to believe the sun would rise. Thus, our emperical knowledge is grounded purely in singular expereinces which seem un-generalizable. Consider the following formalized reconstruction of Leibniz's argument:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>The senses can only ever give us knowledge of singular or instances of experiences.</li>
        <li>We will never be able to observe all instances of any one thing.</li>
        <li>The instances we've observed of a particular thing can not be said to be always generalizable (instances cannot provide logical necessity).</li>
        <li>Thus: The senses are only able to provide us with contingent knowledge of the world but not necessary knowledge.</li>
      </ol>

      <p>
        It is important for Leibniz to state that experiental knowledge is contigent so far as he wishes to contrast such emperical knowledge with rational truths. Leibniz feels that rational truths, unlike emperical truths, are necessarily truth. Examples of such primary truths, as he calls them, are logical and mathematical proofs. These necessary truths Leibniz asserts stand independent of experience. If you consider the logical assumptions: 1. A &amp; 2. A->B. Independent of any experience, we can use purely deductive reasoning to infer from the given premises that B must necessarily follow. This knowledge is necessary and does not rest upon singular experiential instances. Necssary rational truths are purer in a sense than contigent truths in this such sense.
      </p>

      <p>In John Locke's, <i>An Essay Concerning Human Understanding</i>,  Locke develops the view that all knowledge is derived from experience. Unlike Leibniz and other rationalists, Locke claims that there are no innate ideas and rather that at birth the mind is tabula rosa (a blank slate). One supporting argument Locke employs in his argumentation is that even if reason plays a part in the discovery of some knowledge, that does not prove that the knowledge is itself innate. Consider my following reconstruction of Locke argumentation in this vein (Locke, 320):</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Principles which can be said to be known through reason are only innate so far as reasoning itself is innate</li>
        <li>Reasoning itself is "nothing else but the faculting of deducing unknown truths from principles or propositions that are already known" (Locke, 320).</li>
        <li>From 1-2: Until reasoning is employed, any princple cannot be known</li>
        <li>Thus: "Innate" knowledge derived from reason is grounded in experience.</li>
      </ol>

      <p>
        Locke's argument works by pointing out that even if some knowledge were "innate" we would only be able to be realize this knowledge through experience. It may be that there are some fundamental principles we are impugned with at birth that we prima facie "know". However, it would be impossible to ever know that we know these principles without detatching ourselves from experience all together. In order to realize "innate" principles, first we have to employ reason in the deduction of such principles. Further, reasoning is fundamentally an emperically grounded process. To reason, you must be using the senses and experience to make sense of any reasoning. Reasoning cannot exist without experience.
      </p>

      <h2>Epistemological Persepctivism</h2>
      <p>
        Leibniz's and Locke's arguments now developed, I would now like to offer insight into a view I call epistemological perspectivism and how it handle the empericism versus rationalism debate. Epistemological persepcitvisim is the view that propositional knowledge is purely of perspective nature and only of personal value for any given subject. An epistemological persepctivist (or <i>EP</i>) is concerned with determining when they themselves can be said to know some proposition, <i>p</i>. However, an <i>EP</i> is not concerned with knowing when some external subject, <i>S</i>, knows that <i>p</i>. This later inquiry, assumes by its context that knowledge is an objective construct. For an <i>EP</i>, any S knowing that p is a matter of concern for S and S only.
      </p>

      <p>
        If an EP had to choose a winner of the rationalism versus empericism debate, the EP would likely concede that Locke's emperical argumentation is more compatabile with the EP's view than rationalism is. However, to this extent the EP would note that making the rationalism-empericism division is not of any philosophical value.  For an <i>EP</i>, one's pespective is the combination of both rationale and experience. The seperation and attempted determination of whether rationalism or empericism is the "primary" value or grounding of all knowledge in epistemology is a ludacris project for the <i>EP</i>. The fundamental problem the EP would have with both rationalist and empericist theories is that both theories depend on one another intricatly.
      </p>
      <p> 
        When a rationalist says that a matehmatical proof is true indepnednt of experience, they can only say this because they themselves have used experience to deduce so. If there were nothing in this world to count, how could the reationalist develop number theory (surely a mathematical truth, a rationalist would claim exists indepnent of experience). Suppose the world existed of only jelly beans and a single rationalist. The ratioanlist may count the jelly beans and may then deduce: "numbers exist indepnedent of jelly beans! I can add one to two and make three! And I need not think about jelly beans to think about numbers independently!" However, the only reason the rationalist could develop this view that numbers could exist independnt of jelly beans in the first place is that they counted the jelly beans. Remove the jelly beans from this world and the rationalist is left in a null and void world. How could the rationalist now make claims about number theory at all with there nothing left to count in this null and void world? Thus, by this example we can see that rationalism depends on empericism.
      </p>

      <p>
        Alternativly, let us try this the other way around. Say the empericist wants to claim emperical knowledge is the fundamental component or grounding for all of our knowledge. Import the same jelly bean world from the last example only change the rationalist to an empericist. The empericsit in this example might see a jellybean and say: "ooh, wonderful a jellybean!". However, why is it that they can say this? Ofcourse, the empericist took note of the jellybean by use of their sense of vision. However, in order to cognitive process the information of the jellybean itself the empericist had to employ reasoning in the mind to assert such claim. As such, instead of saying "ooh, wonderful a jellybean", what if the empericist claimed alternativily: "aaah, horrible a jellybean!". Where is the line beteween when the sensation stopped and judgment of the jellybean started? Regardless of where this line is, it seems inseperable to consider that we can extract sensory expereinece from rationale all together.  So in this case empericism depends on rationalism.
      </p>

      <p>
        The notion that there is some objective or transcendent notion of knowledge, and furhter that we can ascertain about the origins of knowledge is rediculous. The dependence of rationalism on empericism and empeiricms on rationalism forces anyone who chooses to see the debate clearly to concede there is no clear answer. Thus, this co-dependence seen between rationalism and empericist leads us to return to the view of epimsteomlogical persepctivism. An <i>EP</i> cares so far about knowledge so that they can assert when they know that p and perhaps why they may know that p. However, an <i>EP</i> refuse to care about why others may claim to know that p. Further, even if an external subject S claims to know that p, for the EP the question questioning S's knowledge of p boils down to: how do I, an EP, know that p<sub>2</sub> (where p<sub>2</sub> is S knows that p). And here lies the fundamentall problem with the empericism versus rationalism debate. The empericism versus rationalism debate is essentially a bunch of epistemological persepctivists failing to realize that they themselves are epistemoloigcial persepctivists. 
      </p>

      <p>
        Of course, an individual may hold that maybe rationalism is more fundamental than empericism in the origins of knowledge or visa-versa, but is it worth trying to convince the opposing camp that one persepctive is "right"? Further, for the EP who realizes the co-dependene of rationalism and empericism it is unlikely they will ever believe one side is "better" or "right". The EP cares about only about his own knowledge. Further, in so far as the rationalism-empericism debate doesn't affect the EP's own pragmatic values for his own knowledge, why should he care? Not should the the EP not care if its not in his persepctive to care, he fails to understand why other EPs do care (considering all other subjects to the EP himself, are just fellow EPs).
      </p>

      <p>
        At this point, the empericist or rationalist will likely claim: "This idea of an epistemological persepctivist is absurd! And furthermore, I don't consider myself one!". To this, I can offer little further argumentation but simply point out again that any subject S refusing to be labeled as a EP does not prevent any other EP from viewing S as a fellow EP. I will concede that an empericist or a rationalist doesn't have to consider themselves an EP, however, this will not stop any other EP from considering themselves and indeed anyone who has ever argued as a rationalist or empericst to be merely a fellow EP. 
      </p>
      <p>
        In closing I will make one final note to progress how we should view epistemological persepcitivism. Epistemological persepcitivism is largely akin to agnostic theories seen in religion. While an an inividual may be an agnostic in terms of religion, they may lead a deeply spiritual life. In fact, an agnostic is free to make their own deeply spiritual religion by combining the best components of all existing religions. In a similar vein, an EP knows there to be no objective answer to the empericism versus rationalism debate, however that does not stop the EP from holding some theory of knowledge to be of higher worth than some other theory of knowledge. There can be the emperical-advocate EP, the rationalist-advocate EP, the pragmatic EP, or even the anarchist EP. EPs come in all shapes and sizes and anyone who is an EP views everyone else to be an EP.
      </p>
      <p>
      The whole point of epistemological persepctivism is to realize simply that there is no objective answer to the rationalism empericism debate. Empericist and rationalism persepctives are just that: <i>persepectives</i>. You should care deeply about your own persepective and little about others. So far as you know what you can know and on what basieses you know it, it should not matter if there is some objective answer to the question of the groundings of knowledge. I think an objective answer is out of the question considering the empericism-rationalism-dependnece problem. Thus, my own empisteomlogical persepctive, holds that the empericism-rationalism debate does not matter to me as a philosophical question.
