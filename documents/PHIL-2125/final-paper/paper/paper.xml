      <p>
        In this paper I will present the philosophical debate of empiricism versus rationalism to be of little value to the epistemological perspectivist. To develop this view I will define what it is to be a epistemological perspectivist (EP) and walk through a systematic analysis of rationalism and empiricism showing how both can fit within an EP's system and further show how an EP may thus view the empiricism versus rationalism debate as irrelevant. In (I), I will look at one of Leibniz's rationalism arguments claiming that the senses can only ever provide us with contingent empirical knowledge. Next, in (II), I will reconstruct one of Locke's empirical arguments claiming that even seemingly innate or rational truths are empirically grounded. Then, with these two arguments from the rationalist and empiricist camps developed, in (III), I will present my own notion of what it is to be an epistemological perspectivist. Concluding in (IV), I will reveal myself to be an epistemological perspectivist and further use the notion of epistemological perspectivism to show both: 1. why there is no winner to the empiricism versus rationalism debate and 2. why the empiricism versus rationalism debate doesn't matter.
      </p>

      <h2>I. Leibniz's Rationalist Argument</h2>
      <p>
        In Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz's <i>New Essays on Human Understanding</i>, Leibniz offers a critical rationalist perspective for why the senses are inadequate to provide necessary truths. Leibniz argues experience can only ever give us instances of cause-and-effect relations and that we cannot generalize from certain instances of cause-and-effect relations to necessarily always hold. What this means is that each time we deduce a piece of knowledge from experience, we are only able to deduce this knowledge though noticing the recurrence of singular instances. For example, each morning we may watch the sun rise and resultingly claim: the sun will rise tomorrow morning. However, a priori (or before the original occurrence of the event of the sun rising), it would seem ludicrous to assert that the sun will necessarily rise tomorrow morning. Thus, our empirical knowledge is grounded in singular experiences which may only provide us with contingent but not necessary truths. Consider my following formalized reconstruction of Leibniz's argument (Leibniz, 2-4):
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>The senses can only ever give us knowledge of singular or instances of experiences.</li>
        <li>We will never be able to observe all instances of any one thing.</li>
        <li>The instances we've observed of a particular thing can not be said to be always generalizable (instances cannot provide logical necessity).</li>
        <li>Thus: The senses are only able to provide us with contingent knowledge of the world but not necessary knowledge.</li>
      </ol>

      <h2>II. Locke's Empiricist Argument</h2>

      <p>Now let us turn to an empiricist's perspective of the grounding of knowledge. In John Locke's, <i>An Essay Concerning Human Understanding</i>,  Locke develops the perspective that all knowledge is derived from experience. Unlike Leibniz, Locke claims that there are no innate ideas and rather that at birth the mind is tabula rasa (a blank slate). One supporting argument Locke employs in his perspective is that even if reason plays a part in the discovery of knowledge, that does not prove that reasoning knowledge is itself innate, especially if we consider that the action of reasoning is just an empirical process. Consider my following reconstruction of one of Locke's arguments along this vein (Locke, 320):</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Principles which can be said to be known through reason are only innate so far as reasoning itself is innate.</li>
        <li>Reasoning itself is "nothing else but the faculty of deducing unknown truths from principles or propositions that are already known" (Locke, 320).</li>
        <li>From 1-2: Until reasoning is employed, any principle cannot be known.</li>
        <li>Thus: Since reasoning is itself an empirical process, "innate" knowledge is grounded in experience.</li>
      </ol>
      <h2>III. Epistemological Perspectivism</h2> 
      <p>
        In (IV), I will return to the empiricism versus rationalism debate. However, my argumentation in (IV) addressing the debate only makes sense framed in the context of epistemological perspectivism. As such, I will now introduce epistemological perspectivism.
      </p>
      <p>
        Epistemological perspectivism is the view that epistemological philosophical knowledge is purely of perspective nature and only of subjective and personal value for any given subject. An epistemological perspectivist (or <i>EP</i>) is soley epistemologically concerned with determining why or how they themselves can be said to know some proposition, <i>p</i>. However, an <i>EP</i> is not concerned with knowing why or how some external subject, <i>S</i> knows that <i>p</i>. If one were to embark on this later inquiry, it would assume by its context that knowledge is an objective construct and something we could all agree upon. An EP doesn't care if we can all agree upon the questions of how or why in epistemology. For an <i>EP</i>, any S knowing that p is a matter of concern for S's subjective perspective and S's subjective perspective only.
      </p>

      <p>
        Thus, an EP fully recognizes that other external subjects may want to argue about the questions of how or why in regards to the formations, origins, or nature of knowledge. However, this is not a problem for an EP. The EP simply regardless these arguments as subjective and perspective as so long as they don't seem to affect his own view, he doesn't care about them.  Pragmatically this leads the EP to views everybody else as an EP! Since the EP rejects objective knowledge and only cares about his own epistemological theories (or maybe not at all if he doesn't care to bother thinking) he simply sees epistemological arguments as EPs arguing with one another. One EP can claim rationalism and another EP can claim empiricism, however, if the EP in question is fundamentally a pragmatic or the whole debate does not epistemologically concern this EP, this EP need not care.
      </p>


      <p>
        One way to view epistemological perspectivism is that it is largely akin to agnostic theories seen in religion. While an an individual may be an agnostic in terms of religion, they may lead a deeply spiritual life. In fact, an agnostic is free to make their own deeply spiritual religion by combining the best components of all existing religions.  In a similar vein, an EP holds there to be no objective answer to many epistemological questions including the empiricism versus rationalism debate. However, this rejection of objectivity does not stop the EP from holding some theory of knowledge to be of higher worth than some other theory of knowledge. There can be the empirical-fideist EP, the rationalist-fideist EP, the pragmatic EP, or perhaps even the anarchist EP. Again, EPs come in all shapes and sizes because anyone who is an EP naturally views everyone else in the world to be an EP. Also, you can choose whatever kind of EP you want to be. 
      </p>


      <h2>IV. Why I am an Epistemological Perspectivist</h2>
      <p>
        Now, with epistemological perspectivism introduced, it should seems painstakingly obvious why the philosophical debate of Locke's empiricism versus Leibniz's rationalism doesn't matter: I am an EP! In fact, I am the kind of EP that is along the lines of the hardest-core EPs. I think all knowledge is completely subjective and perspective. I don't think there is any objective knowledge and I really don't care about others' epistemological debates about rationalism versus empiricism! These debates simply don't concern me or my questions for knowledge. Further, it all works out pragmatically in my philosophical system because since I'm an EP I get to believe that we are all EPs!
      </p>

      <p>
        Not only are we all EPs, but many in the field of epistemology are EPs un-necessarily arguing with one another. As seen in (II), Locke's argument points out rationale's dependence on experience. Of course rationalizing is an empirical process and there exists a fundamental dependence of empiricism on rationalism. However, crack open Leibniz's <i>Primary Truths</i> and you'll find something equally as prima facie obvious: empiricism depends on rationalism! Leibniz claims: "all truths are reduced to primary truths... in this consists a priori proof, proof independent of experience" (Leibniz, 265). Now we've got Locke's argument in reverse. I would like to note: I like both these perspectives! Now I have my own epistemological perspective developed in regards to rationale's and experience's dependency relation on one another: there is a fundamental inseparable co-dependence between rationalism and empiricism.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, the burning question in my mind now is: why do the empiricists and rationalist simply not realize this co-dependence between rationalism and empiricism, acknowledge it for what it is, and go on their merry way?  That's too easy. If rationalists and empiricists realized this co-dependence and stopped there they couldn't claim one is more fundamental or the basis for all of our knowledge. One has got to be better than the other they exclaim. Young scholar, you need a label... you must be a rationalist or an empiricist they assert. Further, there must be a "winner" in this war of objectivity! To this extent, Leibniz says experience is a second-class citizen because "primary truths" hold "independent" of experience (Leibniz, 265). But wait a minute Mr.Leibniz, how did you manage to make that inference? Are you some sort of transcendent deductive entity? No, you're stuck in the empirical game just like all of us. And guess what Mr.Locke: you're not some transcendent pure experiential rock just soley taking in the wonderful experience of being rocky. You're a live human stuck in rationalizing game of life.
      </p>

      <p>
        So Locke and Leibniz are the worst kinds of EPs. They are the EPs who don't realize that they themselves are EPs! They are the kinds of EPs that love to argue all day and night to try and be "right" objectively rather than simply accepting what they are arguing for are mere perspectives. They don't stop the rationalism-empiricism dependency when its actualized or purposefully ignored, they simply need assert that one is more fundamental to knowledge. To accept the co-dependency in full is to be an EP, and to be an EP is to surrender, to be weak, to be a child. They want objectivity and reject the notion of being subjective EPs themselves. This is where their problems arise from the ground up. They fail to realize they are EPs and for that, in all honesty, I feel bad for them. When an EP doesn't realize himself to be an EP he may spend days, nights, weeks, years, and or even an entire lifetime arguing to try to convince others of their own subjective perspective.
      </p>
      <p>
        In closing, I will emphasize again the rationale for why epistemological perspectivism has allowed me to disregard the empiricism versus rationalism debate.  Quite simply, I recognize empiricist and rationalist perspectives are just that: <i>perspectives</i>. The debate hasn't concerned me since I realized the inseparable rationalism-empiricism co-dependence long ago. The only reason I'm talking about the topic now is that I must write a paper about it.  For a certain kind of EP, they may value the empiricism versus rationalism debate higher than I do. However, for the sense in which I am an EP,  I fail to care to say if Locke or Leibniz "wins"! Also I fail to accept or argue for a view that the debate at all matters to me philosophically. As an EP, there are actually some epistemological debates that matter to me. However, the empiricism versus rationalism debate is not one of these debates.
