    <div class="response">
      <p>
        In this paper I will present the philosophical debate of empericism versus rationalism to be of little value to the epistemelogical persepectivist. I will develop this view through firstly looking at one of Leibniz's rationalism arguments claiming that the senses can only ever provide us with contigent emperical knowledge in (I). Next, I will reconstruct one of Locke's emperical arguments claiming that even seemingly innate or rational truths are emperically grounded in (II). Then, with these two arguments from the rationalist and empericists camps developed, I will present my own notion of what it is to be an epistemological persepctivist in (III). Then, in (IV), I will reveal myself to be an epistemological persepectivist and further use the notion of epistemological pesepctivism to both: 1. show why there is no winner to the empericism versus rationalism debate and 2. show why the empericism versus rationalism debate doesn't matter. Finally, in closing, I will offer additional insight into the nature and how to view epistemological persepctivism.

      <h2>I. Leibniz's Rationalist Argument</h2>
      <p>
        In Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz's <i>New Essays on Human Understanding</i>, Leibniz offers a critical rationalist persepctive for why the senses are inadequete to provide necessary truths. Leibniz argues experience can only ever give us instances of cause-and-effect relations and that we cannot generalize from cetain instances of cause-and-effect relations to necessarily always hold. What this means is that each time we deduce a piece of knowledge from experience, we are only able to deduce this knowledge though noticing the recurrence of singular instances. For example, each morning we may watch the sun rise and resultingly claim: the sun will rise tomorrow morning. However, a priori (or before the original occurence of the event of the sun rising), it would seem ludacris to assert that the sun will necessarily rise tommorow morning. Thus, our emperical knowledge is grounded in singular expereinces which may only provide us with contigent but not necessary truths. Consider my following formalized reconstruction of Leibniz's argument (Leibniz, 2-4):
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>The senses can only ever give us knowledge of singular or instances of experiences.</li>
        <li>We will never be able to observe all instances of any one thing.</li>
        <li>The instances we've observed of a particular thing can not be said to be always generalizable (instances cannot provide logical necessity).</li>
        <li>Thus: The senses are only able to provide us with contingent knowledge of the world but not necessary knowledge.</li>
      </ol>

      <h2>II. Locke's Empericist Argument</h2>

      <p>Now let us turn to empericist's persepctive of the groundings of our knowledge. In John Locke's, <i>An Essay Concerning Human Understanding</i>,  Locke develops the persepctive that all knowledge is derived from experience. Unlike Leibniz, Locke claims that there are no innate ideas and rather that at birth the mind is tabula rosa (a blank slate). One supporting argument Locke employs in his persepctive is that even if reason plays a part in the discovery of knowledge, that does not prove that the knowledge is itself innate, especially if we consider that the action of reasoning is just an emperical process. Consider my following reconstruction of one of Locke's arguments along vein (Locke, 320):</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Principles which can be said to be known through reason are only innate so far as reasoning itself is innate</li>
        <li>Reasoning itself is "nothing else but the faculting of deducing unknown truths from principles or propositions that are already known" (Locke, 320).</li>
        <li>From 1-2: Until reasoning is employed, any princple cannot be known</li>
        <li>Thus: Since reasoning is itself an emperical process, "innate" knowledge is grounded in experience.</li>
      </ol>
      <h2>III. Epistemological Persepctivism</h2> 
      <p>
        In (IV), I will return to the empericism versus rationalism debate. However, my argumentation in (IV) adressing the debate only makes sense framed in the context of epistemological persepictivsim. As such, I will now introduce epistemological persepctivism.
      </p>
      <p>
        Epistemological persepcitvisim is the view that epistemological philosophical knowledge is purely of perspective nature and only of subjective and personal value for any given subject. An epistemological persepctivist (or <i>EP</i>) is soley epistemologically concerned with determining why or how they themselves can be said to know some proposition, <i>p</i>. However, an <i>EP</i> is not concerned with knowing why or how some external subject, <i>S</i> knows that <i>p</i>. If one were to embark on this later inquiry, it would assume by its context that knowledge is an objective construct and something we could all agree upon. An EP doesn't care if we can all agree upon the questions of how or why in epistemology. For an <i>EP</i>, any S knowing that p is a matter of concern for S's subjetive persepctive and S's subjective persepctive only.
      </p>

      <p>
        Thus, an EP fully recognizes that other external subjects may want to argue about the questions of how or why in regards to the formations, origins, or nature of knowledge. However, this is not a problem for an EP. The EP simply regardless these arguments as subjective and persepective as so long as they don't seem to affect his own view, he doesn't care about them.  Pragmatically this leads the EP to views everybody else as an EP! Since the EP rejects objective knowledge and only cares about his own epistemologicall theories (or maybe not at all if he doesn't care to bother thinking) he simply sees epistemological arguments as EPs arguing with one another. One EP can claim rationalism and another can claim empericism, however, if the EP is fundamentally a pragmatic or the whole debate doesnt epistemologicall concern him, he need not care.
      </p>

      <h2>IV. Why I am an Epistemological Persepctivist</h2>
      <p>
        Now, with epistemological persepctivism introduced, wit should seems obvious why the philsophical debate of Locke's empericism versus Leibniz's rationalism doesn't matter: I am an EP! In fact, I am the kind of EP that is along the lines of the hardest-core EPs. I think all knowledge is completly subjective and persepctive. I don't think there is any objective knowledge and I really don't care about others' epistemological debates!  What my motivation for being an EP? Well, I simply think that we are all EPs! 
      </p>

      <p>
        Not only are we all EPs, but many in the field of epistemology are EPs un-necessarily arguing with one another. As seen in (II), Locke's argument points out rationale's dependence on experience. Of course rationalizing is an emperical process and there exists a fundamental dependence of empericism on rationalism. However, crack open Leibniz's <i>Primary Truths</i> and you'll find something equally as prima facie obvious: empericism depends on rationalism! Leibniz claims: "all truths are reduced to primary truths... in this consists a priori proof, proof indepednent of expiernece" (Leibniz, 265). Now we've got Locke's argument in reverse. I would like to note: I like both these persectives! Now I have my own epistemological perspective developed in regards to rationale and experience relation: there ia a fundamental inseperable co-dependence between rationalism and empericism.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, the burning question in my mind now is: why do the empericists and rationalist simply not realize this co-dependence between rationalism and empericism, acknowledge it for what it is, and go on their merry way?  That's too easy. If rationalists and empericists realizied this co-dependdence and stopped there they they couldn't claim one is more fundamental or the basis for all of our knowledge. One has got to be better than the other they exclaim. There must be a "winner" in this war of objectivity! To this extent, Leibniz says experience is a second-class citizen becuse "primary truths" hold "indepedent" of experience (Leibniz, 265). But wait a minute Mr.Leibniz, how did you manage to make all those inferences? Are you some sort of transecendent deductive entity? No, you're stuck in the emperical game just like all of us. And guess what Mr.Locke: you're not some transcendent pure experiential rock just soley taking in the experience of beign a rock. You're a live human stuck in rationalizing game of life.
      </p>

      <p>
        So Locke and Leibniz are the worst kinds of EPs. They are the EPs who don't realize that they themselves are EPs! They are the kinds of EPs that love to argue all day and night to try and be "right" objectivly rather than simply accepting they what they are arguing more are mere persepctives. They want to assert that to be an EP is to surrend, to be weak, to be a child. They want objectivity and reject the notion of being subjective EPs themselves. This is where their problems arise from the ground up. They fail to realize they are EPs and for that, in all honesty, I feel bad for them. When an EP doesn't realize himself to be an EP he may spend days, nights, weeks, years, and or even an entire lifetime arguing to convince others of their own subjective persepective.
      </p>

      <p>
        In closing, I will make one final note to progress how we should view epistemological persepcitivism. Epistemological persepcitivism is largely akin to agnostic theories seen in religion. While an an inividual may be an agnostic in terms of religion, they may lead a deeply spiritual life. In fact, an agnostic is free to make their own deeply spiritual religion by combining the best components of all existing religions.  In a similar vein, an EP holds there to be no objective answer to many epistemologiical questions including the empericism versus rationalism debate. However, this rejection of objectivity does not stop the EP from holding some theory of knowledge to be of higher worth than some other theory of knowledge. There can be the emperical-advocate EP, the rationalist-advocate EP, the pragmatic EP, or even the anarchist EP. Again, EPs come in all shapes and sizes because anyone who is an EP naturally views everyone else in the world to be an EP. Also, you can choose whaever kind of EP you want to be. For my sense in which I am an EP, I recognize empericist and rationalism persepctives are just that: <i>persepectives</i>. You should care deeply about your own persepective and little about others. So far as you've got your subjective persepctive theories on what you can know, why you know things, so on and so forth... why should you care any more? For a certain kind of EP, they may value the empericism versus rationalism debate higher than I do. However, for the sense in which I am an EP,  I fail to care to say if Locke's or Leibniz "wins"! In my own hard-core rending of being an EP, the empericism versus rationalism is put quite crudely: a waste of my time.
