In Defence of Sartwell's True Belief Analysis of Knowledge
==========================================================
In the face of Gettier, the epistemologist intuits that a JTB analysis of knowledge should be morphed into JTB + X (X being some additional criteria for JTB to sufficiently esape Gettier) . Another route, presented by Crispin Sartwell in Knowledge is Merely True Belief and Why Knowledge is Merely True Belief is to instead skin JTB into TB.

Taking knowledge to be merely true belief

Distinctions in Analyses of Knowledge

- Deontological versus Teleoglocail
    * Deontological

- Normative versus Descriptive
    * Normative

A Primer on Belief

- Braithewait's Account of Belief:
    * S holds belief p iff:
        1.
        2.

Justification: Conducive to the Truth
-------------------------------------
Sartwell's Proof for TB: Why KNowledge is Merely True Belief


Sartwell's Proof for Why K=TB
-----------------------------
1. Knowledge is the deontological goal of inquiry.
2. Justification is a correct normative procedure for inquiry.
3. Justification is a means to knowledge [From 1-2]
4. X beings a means to goal Y does nto make X a necessary component of Y
5. Thus: Justifciation is only an instrument component of Knowldge
