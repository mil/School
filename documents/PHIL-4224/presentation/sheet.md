In Defence of Sartwell's True Belief Analysis of Knowledge
==========================================================
In the face of Gettier, the epistemologist intuits that a JTB analysis of knowledge should be morphed into JTB + X (X being some additional criteria for JTB to sufficiently esape Gettier) . Another route, presented by Crispin Sartwell in Knowledge is Merely True Belief and Why Knowledge is Merely True Belief is to instead skin JTB into TB.

In developing **TB**, Sartwell emphasizes several methodological points:

1. An Analysis of Knowledge should be ***Teleological and Normative***
2. Disposition to assent of a proposition *p* is different from **Entertaining that *p**
3. Both Theories of Justification and Justification in Language serves to Conduce the Truth

Distinctions in Analyses of Knowledge
--------------------------------------
- **Deontological** versus **Teleological**
    * **Deontological**
        - No overarching project
        - Obligations, Permission, Duties
    * **Teleological**
        - Concerned with the overal goal
        - The ends rather than the means
- **Normative** versus **Descriptive**
    * **Normative**
        - How should we generate belief in regards to acquiring knowledge?
        - What is the model or how can we talk about knowledge philosophically?
    * **Descriptive**
        - Branch of Psychology or Cognitive Science 
        -  What are the cognitive mechanisms or belief formation?

A Primer on Belief
------------------
- **Braithewait's Account of Belief**:
    * S holds belief p iff:
        1. S entertains that p.
        2. S has a disposition to act as if p were true.
- **(2) Often Seen in Absence of (1)**
    * Does a gambler who closes his eyes and draws his finger to a horse on a betting form hold the belief that the horse will win?
    * Man awakes from brain surgery asserting Goldbach's Conjecture

Justification: Conducive to the Truth
-------------------------------------
- What do foundationalism, coherentism, and all other theories of justification have in common?
    * They all seem to hold that justifcation primarly seeks to conduce to the truth
    * Justification is thus just of instrumental value to knowledge.
- Justification's Role in Language?
    * Ascertain about the truth of a contorted proposition.
- A Quote from Bonjour:
    * "If finding epistemically justified beliefs did not substaintlly increase the likelihood of finding true ones, epistemic justifcation would be irrelvant to our main cognitive goal and of dubious worth... epistemic justification is therefore in the final analysis only an instrumental value, not an intrinsic one"



Sartwell's Proof for Why K=TB
-----------------------------
1. Knowledge is the deontological goal of inquiry (inquiry = procedures that have their goal in the generation of belief).
2. Justification is a correct normative procedure for inquiry.
3. Justification is a means to knowledge [From 1-2]
4. X beings a means to goal Y does nto make X a necessary component of Y
5. Thus: Justifciation is only an instrument component of Knowldge

Critisisms
-----------
- Kvanig
    * Argument to Sartwell
        - Knowledge is not the goal of inquiry
        - Truth is the goal of inquiry
    * What Sartwell Would Say
        - Knowledge is whatever you say it is teleologically
        - If you accept that K=TB, then..... K=Truth?
        - Need work here...
- Lycan
    * Argument to Sartwell
        - Applies TB to have propositional value
        - Sticks TB into TB itself
        - So long as you believe TB truly, you know TB!
    * What Sartwell Would Say
        - Philosphical Teleological/Normative Arguments don't have propositional vaue
        - These are not the kind of arguments that can ever be "known"

Epistemological Minimalism as A Path to Episteomological Pragmatism
-------------------------------------------------------------------
- TB is minimalism in regards an analysis of Knowledge
- Allows that justification still be debatable
    * In descriptive or deontological discourse
- We already view knowledge pragmatically in this minimal view of TB
- In language:
    * How do you know?
        - What is your justification?
            * Do you hold the belief OR
            * Do you have mere dispotiion to assent on the belif?
    * The How Do You Know Regress:
        - The question How do you know can be pushed to absurdity
        - At some point you will appeal to authority
        - At some point no more justification need be given
            * Or justifcation of claim is embeded in claim itself
- Epistemic Minimalism ---> Epistemic Pragmatism
