    <div id="title">In Defense of Sartwell's True Belief Analysis of Knowledge</div>
    <div class="response">
      <p>
      Gettier cases have spawned a whole slew of theories tacking on an additional criteria for knowledge to the justified true belief analysis of knowledge (JTB). As such, in epistemology the view that is often endorsed as the "solution" to the Gettier problem is that an analysis of knowledge should construe knowledge is at least justified true belief (<i>JTB+</i>). Another approach to the Gettier problem is to consider that an analysis of knowledge should construe knowledge as merely true belief (TB) as presented by Crispin Sartwell in <i>Knowledge is Merely True Belief</i> and <i>Why Knowledge is Merely True Belief</i>. TB is not an anecdote for epistemological anarchy but rather simply suggests a re-evaluation of our analysis of knowledge such that justification be considered merely as instrumental to knowledge. Sartwell feels the Gettier problem points out a critical failing of analyses of knowledge and TB allows us to abstractly address such failing in epistemology and provides a solution by way of a higher-order methodological critique of what a philosophical analysis of knowledge need provide.
      </p>

      <p>
      Overview aside, I will now give a concrete roadmap of my analysis of Sartwell's TB. In (I)-(III) I analyze the motivation for Sartwell's TB consisting of: the rationale for a analysis of knowledge to be teleological and normative in (I), a brief primer on the sense in belief is often referred to in (II), and an anecdotal account of the role of justificatory theories in (III).  Sartwell's motivation for TB properly established, in (IV) I will present my reconstruction of Sartwell's positive argument in favor of TB. Proceeding in (V)-(VII) I will refute criticisms directed at TB by considering how each criticism fails to properly take into account TB's motivation as covered in (I)-(III). Concluding in (VIII), I will offer some final closing remarks on TB's role in the context of epistemology as whole.
      </p>

      <h2>I. The Scope of an Analysis of Knowledge: Teleological and Normative</h2>
      <p>
      In the face of Gettier, the intuition for the epistemologist is to morph JTB into JTB+ rather than skin JTB into TB.  Sartwell pushes for the latter over the former by emphasizing that we need an account of knowledge that is teleological and normative. Although only stressed in Sartwell's second article, <i>Why Knowledge is Merely True Belief</i>, considering the distinctions between both: teleological versus deontological and normative versus descriptive epistemological projects is critical to understanding the scope of TB. It is only through Sartwell appealing to provide in scope a strictly a teleological and normative analysis of knowledge that TB should be considered a functional argument. 
      </p>

      <h2>I.<span class="small">I.</span> TB as a Teleological Theory, not a Deontological Theory</h2>
      <p>
      A teleological epistemology project should seek very generally to understand the ends and ultimate goals of knowledge. A teloelogical project is in contrast with a deonotological project which should seek to understand the methodological processes of belief forming and how we can obtain knowledge in terms of every day action. A crude rendering of this distinction from a birds-eye view would be: a deonotological project is concerned with the means; while a teleological project is concerned with the ends.
      </p>
      <p>
      Sartwell asserts that an analysis of knowledge should be strictly a teleological conception and not at all bridge into deontology. What is the motivation for this view? There is already a deontological component of knowledge: justification. Furthermore, it can be seen that justificatory theories within epistemology conform to this idea of being deontological in nature.  Consider one such theory of when some subject, S, is justified in believing some proposition, p:
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        "Person S is ex ante justified in believing p at t if and only if there is a reliable belief-forming operation available to S which is such that if S applied that operation to this total cognitive state at t, S would believe p at t-plus-delta (for a suitably small delta) and that belief would be ex post justified" (Goldman, 171). 
      </blockquote>

      <p>
      This analysis Goldman gives of when someone is "reliably" justified sounds quite in depth and distinctly <i>technical</i>. However, while this account is quite in depth  and <i>technical</i>, this is the case rightly so because it happens to  be the last rendering Goldman reaches of what it is to be "reliably" justified in an entire article, <i>Reliablism: what is justified belief</i>, which sets out to specify just this sense in when someone is deontologically reliably justified. Thus, we can note that deontological justificatory theories drill down completely on the means in regards to the formation of belief but disregard any sort of higher purpose of such theory. In Goldman's reliablist theory, he talks extensively about what exactly it is to be reliably justified, at what time, and in what cognitive states. However we will note that Goldman intentionally wholly ignores adherence to some higher purpose of his justificatory theory other than that a justificatory should <i>get at</i> truth. But why is the truth an important factor? Why do we want to get at the truth? To this, Goldman provides no concessions. 
      </p>

      <p>
      Thus, theories of justification serve a purpose distinct from that of analyses of knowledge... their purpose is deontological. This idea that the deonotological component of epistemological inquiry to truth is already present in epistemology is Sartwell's motivation for the idea that an analysis of knowledge should be strictly teleological. Justificatory theories are by their nature deontological specifications to "track the truth". They consider the means of how to get to the end goal of the truth, however, they are not at all concerned with the nature of the end goal of the truth or why we might want to have the truth. Contrarily, teleological accounts such as the account Sartwell wishes to provide works in terms of end goal rather than the means. Teleological accounts care about the ends and not the means.
      </p> 

      <h2>I.<span class="small">II.</span> TB as a Normative Theory, not a Descriptive Theory</h2>
      <p>
      In addition to Sartwell wishing to provide a telological conception of knowledge, he adds that an analysis of knowledge should be normative rather than descriptive. A normative epistemology project should address philosophical questions such as: "How should we generate beliefs with regard to achieving knowledge? How should inquiry be conducted and evaluated? And what, exactly, is its goal, i.e., what is knowledge?". These kinds of normative questions are in contrast to descriptive epistemology which is essentially an extension of psychology or cognitive science that seeks to determine identifying reliable belief forming processes or seeking out the cognitive mechanisms involved in the generation of beliefs and formation of knowledge. As such, Sartwell seeks for a normative project in his analysis of knowledge over a descriptive project. Sartwell's intention for TB is more along the line of philosophical analysis than explaining descriptive cognitive processes.
      </p>

      <p>
      The normative versus descriptive distinction is critical for properly understanding Sartwell's argument. Sartwell notes that existing analyses of knowledge fail because they don't determine whether their account of knowledge is descriptive or normative. Furthermore, I will note that saying that TB should provide a normative rather than descriptive analysis of knowledge frees TB from needing to provide any sort of analytic and objective sense in which TB is "true". Thus, we must consider the propositional content that TB may hold in a normative sense is distinctly separate from propositional content seeking the truth in a descriptive sense.
      </p>

      <p>
      To illustrate this difference, consider the case when you open your eyes in the morning, look out the window, and see the sun rising. Pre-analytically you can state the sun is rising. Further, the proposition that the sun is rising can then be said to be true in virtue of its descriptive propositional content. Contrarily, while a philosophically normative claim such as TB may said to be propositional in that it is possible to state whether TB is true or false, the sense in which TB may be true or false is different.  This distinction is critical and will be brought back into the light by criticisms Lycan makes of TB in (VI), however for now it will suffice that the reader need keep in mind: TB is a mere normative <i>theory</i> analyzing what knowledge is. Furthermore, a normative theory should be considered in terms of propositional content with adherence to the truth in a different sense than a descriptive propositions may be in a way "absolutely" true of false.
      </p>

      <p>
      To sum up (I), the teleological and normative scope in which Sartwell frames TB is critical for his argument. By explicitly stating the epistemological taxonomy of TB to be teleological and normative outright, TB can withstand extensive counter-argumentation. Sartwell feels that many of the shortcomings of other epistemological theories of knowledge along the lines of JTB and JTB+ can be seen as failings to distinguishing whether a theory is assumed to be teleological versus deontological and normative versus descriptive. Thus, explicitly stating where any given analysis falls in such taxonomy is critical. Counter-argumentation covered in (V)-(VII) will re-emphases these distinctions by showing how problems with TB are merely mis-understandings of the normative teleological nature of TB. Until re-emphasis later on, please keep in mind: TB is designed to simply and merely be a normative teleological theory for an analysis of knowledge.
      </p>


      <h2>II. A Primer on Belief: Can a Lucky Guess be Knowledge?</h2>

      <p>One of the initial concerns for TB offered by the JTB+ advocate might be to assert that it is incoherent to build an analysis of knowledge lacking justification simply because on such account lucky guesses could easily be counted as knowledge. To this conjecture, it is essential we consider the way in which Sartwell regards belief. Sartwell defines belief according to the account R. B. Braithwaite's offers in <i>The Nature of Believing</i>. According to Braithwaite's account, for a subject <i>S</i> to hold the belief that <i>p</i>, the following two criteria must be met: 
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li>S entertains p</li>
        <li>S has a disposition to act as if p were true</li>
      </ol>

      <p>
      Sartwell uses the construction above to highlight two critical features of belief. The first feature is that the presence of (2) can quite often be observed in the absence (1). The example Sartwell cites to this extent is that of the gambler who closes his eyes, draws his finger to a horse on a racing form, and then bets the baby on that horse. The gambler's proposition that the horse will win, p, is not entertained in this instance but rather the gambler merely has disposition to bet on the horse. His disposition is simple: he's a gambler.  Perhaps if the gambler had some sort of complex statistical system then maybe he could entertain p and p would meet the criteria of belief. However, this brings into question deontological conceptions of justification of which Sartwell is not concerned. Thus, in this case we can say that the gambler simply had disposition. Disposition can come in many forms but only in the case that disposition aligns with <i>S</i> entertaining that <i>p</i> were actually true can we assert that <i>S</i> held the belief that <i>p</i>. 

      </p>
      <p> 
      The second critical feature of belief is that no belief stands in isolation.  Sartwell cites the case of a man who's brain is operated on by a mad scientist and the man awakes asserting that "Goldbach's conjecture is true". No evidence  but mere disposition stands in this case as well and it would seem that for the man to entertain the proposition that "Goldbach's conjecture is true" would be unjustified. Sartwell asserts that "I cannot have the belief that Goldbach's conjecture is true and fail to have any related beliefs" (158). Belief is a notion intertwined with a system of beliefs and merely asserting a true claim does not count as knowledge. If there is reason, or justification on the level of belief for the claim to be true, then it is possible to entertain the claim and form belief. However, as Sartwell points out: "If the claim is withdrawn as soon as it is brought into question... we may rightly say it was not believed".
      </p>

      <p>
      In conclusion to this section note: the typical inclination of the JTB+ advocate to criticize TB for including lucky gueseses in the scope of knowledge fails. A proposition must have some reason to be entertained to be considered a belief. Lucky guesses do not meet the criteria for belief in most cases. Thus, before passing a belief into any analysis of knowledge, such as TB, we need consider as a precursor the question: are we even dealing with an instance of a belief?
      </p>

      <h2>III. The Role of Justification: Truth-Conduciveness</h2>
      <p>
      The core of TB is to construe not that justification is an superfluous concept, but rather to conclude that justification should be construed as being merely of instrumental value to knowledge. Proper proof for this claim will follow in (IV), but for now I would like to highlight Sartwell's motivation for this view. Sartwell points out that an anecdotal account of theories of justification, from both coherentist and reliablist accounts, offer different methodologies in regards to the formation of beliefs. However, the critical convergence for all existing theories of justification is that they seek truth-conduciveness. Both internalist and externalist accounts of knowledge will concede that the purpose of justification is to provide methodology as to be truth-conducive.  Sartwell directly cites the coherentist Laurence Bonjour in saying:
      </p> 
      <blockquote>
        "If finding epistemically justified beliefs did not substantially increase the likelihood of finding true ones, epistemic justification would be irrelevant to our main cognitive goal and of dubious worth... epistemic justification is therefore in the final analysis only an instrumental value, not an intrinsic one". 
      </blockquote>
      <p>
      Sartwell additionally adds that while Bonjour explicitly states that justification is of mere instrumental value to knowledge, all proponents of justification implicitly concede that justification is of mere instrumental value as well. It must be the case that justification is of mere instrumental value to knowledge if justification is construed as having a purpose of solely conducing to the truth. Further, there are no accounts of justification that hold justification to be intrinsic to the value of knowledge. This discussion of justification as being instrumental to knowledge links back up with the deontological nature of justification as discussed in (I) in that justificatory are instrumentally deontological. Justificatory theories hold only instrumental to knowledge because they are designed to do just this, conduce the truth. Truth on its own is a separate entity from justification and thus justification merely serves as an instrumental path to get to the truth.
      </p>
      <p>
      Thus, how should theories of knowledge view justification, considering that justification is of mere instrumental value in conducing to the truth? Simply, knowledge should be construed as merely true belief. And thus, with Sartwell's major methodological and motivational components of TB now illustrated,  I will proceed to Sartwell's positive argument in favor of TB.
      </p>

      <h2>IV. Sartwell's Proof for TB: Why Knowledge is Merely True Belief</h2>
      <p>
      (I)-(III) established it now is appropriate to introduce Sartwell's proof for TB which he presents in <i>Why Knowledge is Merely True Belief</i>. Consider my following reconstruction of Sartwell's argument for TB:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Knowledge is the goal of Inquiry (inquiry defined as: procedures that have their goal in generation of belief)</li>
        <li>Justification is a correct procedure for Inquiry</li>
        <li>Justification is a means to Knowledge<i>[From (1)-(2)]</i></li>
        <li>A proper specification of goal Y need not solely be defined by some means X</li>
        <li>Thus: Justification is only an instrumental component of Knowledge</li>
      </ol>


      <h2>V. Objections Misunderstanding TB's Teleology: Kvanvig's Attack on TB</h2>
      <p>
      Johathan Kvanvig in an article entitled <i>The Value of Knowledge is External to It</i> attacks (1) arguing: "Is knowledge the goal of inquiry?... When we engage in inquiry we are trying to get to the truth about the subject matter in question. Inquiry ceases when we take ourselves to have found the truth". Kvanvig contends that inquiry is intended to be truth-seeking rather than knowledge-seeking. Thus inquiry should be "directed at finding the truth" and trying to "avoid error".  Kvanvig thinks that very generally <i>seeking the truth</i> and <i>avoiding anything that is not the truth</i> rather than simply <i>seeking knowledge</i> should be construed as the goal of inquiry.
      </p>

      <p>
      Sartwell indeed anticipates such counter-objection as Kvanvig offers and concedes that (1) is un-defended. However, Sartwell notes that any teleological analysis of knowledge need make such inference.  An teleological analysis of inquiry is bound to such inclination and Sartwell poses the question that if <i>knowledge</i> is not the goal of inquiry or the epistemological telos then why a "tremendous emphasis has been placed on the theory of knowledge in the history of philosophy"? Further, Sartwell inquires what better goal might be construed for a normative teleological goal for inquiry in epistemology? 
      </p>

      <p>
      Along this vein, let us assume for sake of argument that instead of <i>knowledge</i> as Sartwell contends, <i>seeking truth and avoiding error</i> as Kvanvig explicitly states is the telos or goal of inquiry. Under this view, we might suppose that truth may be reached in multiple courses instrumentally or directly. There can be multiple courses for inquiry that are all considered good actions conforming to reaching the goal of the truth and avoiding error.  The question now becomes: where is the line to be drawn between which is of more importance: seeking truth or avoiding error? Which of these goals is more important for inquiry? If they are both equally important then I see no reason why lucky guesses are any better than justified true beliefs in actions conforming to the teleological goal of inquiry. If we were to assume epistemic agents had doxastic control over any beliefs why would flipping a coin not be a perfectly adequate method for inquiry? Although flipping a coin may not always avoid error, it will always seek the truth and flipping a coin will yield a 50% shot that error is avoided. Flipping a coin would still be inquiry just as much as forming a justified true belief because it considers both goals of inquiry and under one goal of inquiry it may actually progress our inquiry in... getting the truth.
      </p>

      <p>
      From this analysis I must conclude that Kvanvig has a poor sense of what it is to have a teleological analysis of knowledge. Kvanvig conflates two goals within his telos of inquiry and thus crosses into the realm of deontology. Further, it should be noted that seeking the truth and avoiding error is exactly what deontological theories of justification attempt to do. For example, a reliablist theory of justification seeks a similar goal as to what Kvanvig's teleological goal for inquiry attempts to do. A reliablist theory of justification can be said to seek truth and avoid errors by way of providing the subject with only reliable methods of justification. Thus, Kvanvig's problem is that he is asking too much of a teleological goal of inquiry. 
      </p>

      <p>
      Kvanvig's analysis of what a telological goal of inquiry need entail required multiple components. Requiring multiple components and specifying such means is along the lines of deontological conceptions of justifications and it would seem as if under Kvanvig's account of inquiry less room is left for justificatory theories mechanics. Perhaps under some account of justification truth and falsity are valued equally. Or perhaps we should value truth more than avoiding falsity. Or perhaps visa-versa: we should value avoiding falsity more than truth. It is unclear where Kvanvig draws the line and conflation of two goals in a teleological goal for inquiry proves Kvanvig's interpretation of how a teleological goal for inquiry as insufficient.
      </p>

      <p>
      Additionally, Sartwell puts it as: "I would ask my accusers at this point whether they can set out to analyze or describe without begging the question in favor of some such theory". Begging the question is an unavoidable question for both TB or any other teleological theory. Set X to be what your goal of inquiry is  and it will always be  possible that the motive for X can always be questioned. As such, outside of a deeper study on linguistics or virtue theory I believe no further inquiry need be intuited. I think any reply Kvanvig gives along the lines that knowledge is not the goal of inquiry should be considered trivial in the epistemic teleological scope we are talking.
      </p>

      <p>
      (1) aside, Kvanvig gives a separate criticism of (4). Kvanvig claims that while often (4) is granted, it is also sometimes the case that the means to something does in fact constitute a necessary component of its goal. Kvanvig cites the example: "If becoming elected a senator is the result of a successful campaign, then running a successful campaign can be both a means to this goal and a constituent as well" (42). Kvanvig adds that while Sartwell wishes to claim that a means to a goal does not make said means necessary for a goal, in many cases means toward a goal are both necessary and sufficient for achieving that goal. Kvanvig cites a second example that a means toward getting a million dollars is "getting a half a million, or getting nine hundred thousand, or getting the first dollar" in claiming "means can be necessary constituent of the goal in question".
      </p>

      <p>
      In regards to Kvanvig's criticisms he provides in rejection of (4), again I must appeal to the telological nature of Sartwell's argument. Sartwell's argument is <i>not</i> intended to be concerned with means as so much it is concerned with the goal of inquiry generally.  Thus, I am not sure if Kvanvig's criticisms he provides in rejection of (4) holds any ground as posed teleologically and normatively so much as posed descriptively and deontologically.  As mentioned in (II), determining what the means to get to a goal are is a perfectly legitimate concern for a <i>deontological</i> epistemological project. However, again, Sartwell is not concerned with constructing a deontological epistemological project. Sartwell's goal is to provide the general teleological framework for an analysis of knowledge. In doing so, with (4) he is merely pointing out that justification currently serves as one means in conforming to the goal of inquiry. 
      </p>

      <p>Thus, we find that in (4) and additionally as in (1), Kvanvig misunderstand the normative teleological scope of Sartwell's argument. A teleological theory as explored in (II) need adhere to the end goals <i>rather</i> than the means. However, a deontological or descriptive theory can be a component of a teleological normative theory. As such, these questions are left in deontological theories of justification. 
      </p>

      <p>
      One further point I would like to make in light of Kvanvig's criticisms offer to TB is that: Sartwell's positive proof for TB absolutely imports the dependency of being normative in its analytical sense. Sartwell's first paper, <i>Knowledge is Merely True Belief</i>, does not contend to offer <i>any</i> sense in which such formulation is proposed outside of an looking at an anecdotal account of knowledge. What I mean by this is simply that Sartwell's argument is not pure positive proof that knowledge is true belief in some sort of pre-analytic sense in which Kvanvig wishes to bestow upon TB. Much argumentation can take Sartwell's positive proof for TB as found in <i>Why Knowledge is True Belief</i> in isolation and point out critical failings of TB's inductive nature. I cannot argue against these criticisms directly, but simply I must refer the reader to understand that Sartwell's argument is best and only should be taken in the conjunction of both of his papers.
      </p>


      <h2>VI. Objections Misunderstanding TB's Normativity</h2>
      <p>
      When the word <i>analysis</i>, in <i>analysis of knowledge</i> is heard I think that it implicitly suggest that the account given should be <i>descriptive</i>. This is not the case in which TB provides an analysis of knowledge and as such as covered in (I.II), TB is to be taken in a strictly normative sense. In this section I will cover two objections to TB that miscomprehended the normative nature in which TB is framed. Hopefully responses to these criticisms will give the reader some insight why face value inclinations to refute TB arise and why they pose no serious problems for TB taking into consideration TB's normative nature.
      </p>


      <h2>VI.<span class="small">I. </span> Lycan's Critism of TB</h2>

      <p>
      In an article entitled <i>Sartwell's Minimalist Analysis of Knowledge</i>, William Lycan criticizes TB in a deduction by showing that if one believes TB and further that if we assume for reduction that TB is in fact true then we can derive by way of TB that one could <i>know TB</i>. Lycan presents his proof as:
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li>Sartwell believes TB. [Premise; I presume he is sincere]</li>
        <li>TB is true. [Assumption for <i>reductio</i>]</li>
        <li>If TB is true, then whoever believes truly that P, knows that P. [Trivial, given what TB says.]</li>
        <li>If (1) and (2), then Sartwell knows TB. [From (3).]</li>
        <li>Thus: Sartwell knows TB. [(1), (2), (4).]</li>
      </ol>

      <p>
      In response to Lycan, we must question the motivation to which Lycan would pose such criticism of a normative analysis of knowledge to begin with. Namely, we should question Lycan's assumption for reduction, (2). While I do concede that one could hold a sincere disposition to a normative philosophical claim, I do not think that (2) or for that matter any normative claim could be entertained in the manner of belief for which TB being a normative philosophical analysis of knowledge is designed. TB is not a descriptive theory that is designed in itself to handle descriptive critique. TB is a formalized account of a <i>normative proposition</i> designed to handle and normatively make sense of other <i>descriptive propositions</i> or <i>normative propositions</i>. Although, I use the terminology that TB is a normative <i>theory</i> rather than <i>proposition</i> prior to this section, a theory can just as easily be seen to have propositional content. However, if we consider any normative theory to have propositional content or rather render a normative theory <i>as</i> a normative proposition, the sense in which such statement can be propositional is different than the sense in which a descriptive statement can be propositional. Intuitively viewed, the truth of a normative proposition may only ever view truth <i>normative</i> rather than descriptively.  For deeper explanation of this difference, let us recall Braithwaite's account of belief as explained in (II). According to Braithewaite's account of belief, some subject S believes that p if and only if both:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>S entertains p</li>
        <li>S has a disposition to act as if p were true</li>
      </ol>

      <p>
      For both descriptive propositions and normative propositions, the sense in which S might entertains that p were true in Braithewaite's account of belief can be applied positively in either case. However, the key difference between the application of "entertaining" a proposition normatively versus descriptively is the sense in which the truth is referenced. For a descriptive proposition the truth is unquestionable, apparent, and unwaivering. Things are how they are because it would be absurd to think of them as any other way. Descriptive propositions are just that, they appeal to the truth in that they describe things in reference to the truth of how they descriptively are. Descriptive propositions are to be taken <i>at face value</i> rather than in some deeply analytic sense.  On the other hand, a normative proposition handles the truth in a difference sense. A normative proposition can only be true in so far as it is true in virtue of the subjective nature of its believer. A normative proposition is designed to provide a subjectively good <i>model</i> for understanding the truth of other propositions (whether the other propositions are normative or descriptive in nature). To get a better sense of this distinction between descriptive and normative propositions let us consider an example of a way in which some proposition could be considered in either category descriptive or normative. Any proposition can technically pre-analytically be classified in either category; however, intuitively certain propositions naturally fall in one category. Consider our example proposition is p: "the door is red".
      </p>
      <p>
      At face value this proposition that the door is red, p, seems likely it would be descriptive in its propositional value. As such, if you were to put two subjects in a room together and one subject were to state p, it would seem seem absurd for the other subject to deny that p positively. If there is a sense in which both subjects can understand red, the question of whether the door is actually red or not is not of concern. The one subject stating that p, is simply describing that it is apparent descriptively that p is the case.
      </p>

      <p>
      However, if you take this same proposition, the door is red, on the normative level then another level of analysis can be applied. Again, normative analysis is concerend with providing a <i>model</i> rather than the apparent description of the way things are. Thus, if one subject were to state p and the other subject were to interpret p normatively rather than descriptively a new set of questions could be asked. p could always be rendered true or false normatively if the model which p falls into seems insufficient to the judging subject. So there is a diminished sense of "truth" in any proposition that is claimed to be normative. Regardless however, this is why you don't hear very often of propositional analogs of normative claims. Or rather, it is contradictory in one sense to interpret any statement within a normative propositional construal.
      </p>

      <p>
      This explained, it should seem apparent why Lycan's criticism of TB seems wholly unfounded. TB is a normative <i>theory</i>. No where in either <i>Knowledge is Merely True Belief</i> or in <i>Why Knowledge is Merely True Belief</i> does Sartwell propose that TB should be taken as anything more than a normative theory. Normative theories can be viewed in terms of propositional value, however I am not sure if it is progressive to the sense in which any normative theory is meant to take form that it be viewed solely propositionally. This is in contrast with descriptive theories which often are questioned rigor.
      </p>
      <p> 
      Now the reader may ask: why do you bother to present Sartwell's view of TB descriptively in (IV) then if normative claims should not be take propositionally? To this intuition I must merely point out that normative claims can take the form of descriptions, however there adherence in terms of logical truth is different from logical proofs. Sartwell never provides an explicit proof such as I do in (IV) for TB and fittingly my account is merely to illustrate the simplistic nature of Sartwell argument stated. Again, if you take the argument presented in (IV) in isolation without taking into account Sartwell's methodological considerations provided in (I)-(III), it is easy to see TB as insufficient. However, to fully grasp and make sense of Sartwell's argument, the teleological nature of TB must be adequately taken into account.

      <h2>VII.<span class="small">II.</span> But Gettier Cases Are Not Knowledge</h2>
      <p>
      At this point I would like to introduce a potential objection which I have not found argued against Sartwell explicitly in the literature, but it is surely present. The objection I speak of is that of the JTB+ advocate arguing: "Gettier cases cannot be instances of knowledge". The JTB+ advocate will likely balk at TB solely for the reason that it seems intuitively wrong to call Gettier cases instances of knowledge. Consider the classical Gettier case: 
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        Jones' boss tells him that the man who will get the job has ten coins in his pocket. Further, Jones has the evidence that Smith has ten coins in his pocket. On these two pieces of evidence, Jones forms the belief that p: the man who will get the job has ten coins in his pocket. As it turns out, Jones' boss has deceived him and it is not Smith who will get the job but Jones himself. Jones gets the job and looks in his pocket and as it turns out he has ten coins in his pocket. Did Jones know that p?
      </blockquote>

      <p>
      A JTB+ advocate would surely deny that Jones knew that p. Furthermore, the JTB+ advocate would be disgusted with TB at this point because they would likely believe that TB would grant Jones the knowledge that p. However, why is it relevant or of any epistemological importance to deny <i>or</i> grant Jones the knowledge that p? The answer to this question reaches deep into what we should desire of an philosophical epistemic analysis of knowledge. Denying or granting Jones the knowledge that p either way should not be considered as a concern for an epistemic analysis of knowledge. Why? Simply put: doing so is a deontological and descriptive activity. Further, deontological descriptive activity should not be considered within the scope of epistemology.
      </p>

      <p>
      TB doesn't provide a solution to the Gettier problem in the same way that JTB+ theories provide an answer to the Gettier problem, rather TB disregards the Gettier problem all together. JTB+ theories posited to date largely seek to fix the JTB analysis of knowledge such that we can deny Jones the knowledge that p however keep JTB the overarching goal for the analysis of knowledge. However, why is this a relevant problem to be concerned with. TB doesn't think it is a relevant problem at all. The solution to the Gettier problem is not to seek out an analysis of knowledge such that Jones doesn't have knowledge in Gettier cases, but an analysis of knowledge should disregard the question all together.
      </p>

      <p>
      Furthermore, TB allows us to do just this. If we explicitly state that an analysis of knowledge should be normative rather than teleological, we don't have to grant to deny Jones any knowledge. As seen with Lycan's criticisms in (VII.II) trying to use normative philosophical theories descriptively does us no good. It creates pointless arguments that need not be argued.
      </p>

      <h2>VIII. In Conclusion, What is it to Know?</h2>

      <p>
      For a JTB+ advocate, maybe TB is disappointing merely because it doesn't seek out the same scope for which JTB+ sets out. As seen in (VII), the overarching purpose of TB is not to provide a "solution" to the Gettier problem. TB points us at a bigger question within epistemology. TB hopes to shift the direction in which we are epistemologically thinking. TB, or epistemological minimalism, leads us in new directions in epistemology.
      </p>

      <p>

      Is not the ultimate epistemological goal truths? What is our motive in caring to be right for the right epistemological reasons?  The Gettier case I feel truly reveals the beauty of TB. On TB, Jones can know that p but at the same time not be justified that p.  Whether or not Jones is justified that p will likely solely rest on which theory of justification Jones adheres to. Maybe on some justificatory theory A, Jones is justified in p and on justificatory theory B Jones is not justified in p. However, knowledge is not the question Gettier should have initially concerned himself with. If we were to interview Jones and ask him if he did know that p, he would likely reply, "Surprisingly, I did!". 
      </p>

      <p>
      The Gettier case illustrates an interesting observation for the distinction between knowledge and justification. While justification is relatively subjective in that depending on which theory of justification you adhere to, whether you were justified that p can vary. As such, the narcissist Jones will likely concede that of course he was justified in p, while the meek Jones may say no I wasn't justified that p. However, knowledge is not and should not be as forgiving. Outside of the field of philosophical epistemological endeavors I think it would be rather absurd to claim that Jones didn't have knowledge of some true belief. While the Gettier case and my explanation may seem like begging the question for TB, I think accepting a theory of knowledge ultimate boils down how exactly "knowledge" is referred to anecdotally.
