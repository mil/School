    <div id="title">In Defense of Sartwell's True Belief Analysis of Knowledge</div>
    <div class="response">
      <p>
        Gettier cases have spawned a whole slew of theories tacking on an additional criteria for knowledge to the justified true belief analysis of knowledge (JTB). As such, in epistemology the view that is often endorsed as the solution to the Gettier problem is that an anlaysis of knowledge should contrue knowledge is at least justified true belief (<i>JTB+</i>). Another approach to the Gettier problem is to consider an analysis of knowledge to be merely true belief (TB) as presented by Crispin Sartwell in <i>Knowledge is Merely True Belief</i> and <i>Why Knowledge is Merely True Belief</i>. TB is not an anecdote for epistemological anarchy but rather simply suggests a re-evaluation of the analysis of knowledge such that justification considered as merely instrumental to knowledge. TB avoids the Gettier problem all together by actually including Gettier cases as cases of knowledge. Proceeding, in (I-III) I will analyze the motivation for Sartwell's TB, in (IV) I will present my reconstruction of Sartwell's argument in favor of TB, in (V-VII) I will refute criticisms directed at TB, and concluding with (VIII-IX) I will offer additional explanation of why counter-argumentation to TB is bound to be easily refuted by emphasizing the key methodology Sartwell takes in the development of TB.
      </p>

      <h2>I. The Scope of an Analysis of Knowledge: Teleological and Normative</h2>
      <p>
        In the face of Gettier, the intuition for the epistemologist is to morph JTB into JTB+ rather than skin JTB into TB.  Sartwell pushes for the latter over the former by emphasizing that we need an account of knowledge that teleological and normative. Although only stressed in Sartwell's second article, <i>Why Knowledge is Merely True Belief</i>, considering the distinctions between both: telelogical versus deontological and normative versus descriptive epistemological projects is critical to understanding the scope of TB. It is only through Sartwell appealing to provide in scope a strictly a teleological and normative analysis of knowledge that TB should be considered a functional argument. 
      </p>

      <p>
        Firstly: a teleological epistemology project should seek very generally to understand the ends and ultimate goals of knowledge. A teloelogical project is in contrast with a deonotological project which should seek to understand the methodological processes of belief forming and how we can obtain knowledge in terms of every day action. A crude rendering of this distinction from a birds-eye view is that a deonotological project could largely be concerned with the means while a telogogical project is concerned with the ends.
      </p>
      <p>
        Sartwell asserts that an analysis of knowledge should be strictly a telelogical conception and not at all bridge into deontology. What is the motivation for this view? There is already a deontological component of knowledge: justification. Furthermore, it can be seen that justificatory theories within epistemology conform to this idea of being deontological in nature.  Consider one such theory of when some subject, S,w is justified in beliving some proposition, p:
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        "Person S is ex ante justified in believing p at t if and only if there is a reliable belief-forming operation available to S which is such that if S applied that operation to this total cognitive state at t, S would believe p at t-plus-delta (for a suitably small delta) and that belief would be ex post justified" (Goldman, 171). 
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        This analysis Goldman gives of when someone is "reliably" justified sounds quite in depth and distinctly <i>technical</i>. However, while this account is quite in depth  and <i>technical</i>, this is the case rightly so for its the last rendering Goldman reaches of what it is to be "reliably" justified in an entire article dedicated to determining just this, <i>Reliablism: what is justified belief</i>. Thus, deontological justificatory theories drill down completly on the means in regards to the formation of belief but seems to be ignorant of any sort of higher puprose of such thoery. In Goldman theory, he talks extensivly about what exactly it is to be reliably justified, at what time, in what cogntive state, howver he fails to conform to some higher purpose of the justificatory theory other than in conformance to the truth. Under Goldman's view, generally, reliably justified beliefs are better than non-reliably justified beliefs because there is no overarching conformance to why exactly having true beliefs is a valid concern to have.
      </p>

      <p>
        Thus, this is the motivation for Sartwell's notion that an analysis of knowledge should be strictly telelological. Justificatory thoery are by their nature defined to be deontological and in a way "track the truth". They consider the means of how to get to the truth however they are not at all concerned with the nature of the end goal of the truth at all. Contrarily, teleological accounts such as the account Sartwell wishes to provide works in terms of end goals.
      </p> 
      <p>
        What is knowledge's end goal one might then inquire of an analysis of knowledge? To this Sartwell offers that "knowledge is our epistemic goal in the gernation of partcular propositional beliefs". This 
      </p>

      <p>
        Secondly: in addition to Sartwell wishing to provide a telological conception of knowledge, he adds that an analysis of knowledge should be normative rather than descriptive. A normative epistemology project should address the philosophical questions such as: "How should we generate beliefs with regard to achieving knowledge? How should inquiry be conducted and evaluated? And what, exactly, is its goal, i.e., what is knowledge?". These kinds of normative questions are in contrast to descriptive epistemology which is essentially an extension of psychology or cognitive science that seeks to determine identifying reliable belief forming processes or seeking out the cognitive mechanisms involved in the generation of beliefs and formation of knowledge. As such, Sartwell seeks for a normative project in his analysis of knowledge over a descriptive project. Sartwell's intention for TB is more along the line of philosophical analysis than explaining descriptive cognitive processes.
      </p>

      <p>
        The teloelogical and normative scope in which Sartwell choses to work is critical for his proposal of TB. By explicitly stating the epistomlogical taxonomy (teleological/deontological and normative/descriptive) outright from which his theory for TB is motivated, Sartwell is able to avoid counterargumentation as seen will be seen in (V)-(VII).  Sartwell's taxonomoy is largely modeled after a parallel to ethical systems developed by William Alston and he concedes to work strictly in a normative and teleological framework. Many of the shortcomings of epistemological theories of knowledge along the lines of JTB/JTB+ can be seen as failings in distinguishing what is teleological versus what is deontological. It is obvious the two are intertwined in a complex fashion, however for now it will suffice for me to simply emphasize that Sartwell is strictly concerned with a teleological normative analysis of knowledge.  By limiting TB's scope to be a strictly teleological and normative account, Sartwell puts TB in the position of just appealing to determine the ultimate goals of knowledge and very generally what knowledge is and determine in what sense knowledge is valuable anecdotally.
      </p>


      <h2>II. A Primer on Belief: Can a Lucky Guess be Knowledge?</h2>

      <p>One of the initial concerns for TB offered by the JTB+ advocate might be to assert that it is incoherent to build an analysis of knowledge lacking justification simply because on such account lucky guesses could easily be counted as knowledge. To this conjecture, it is essential we consider the way in which Sartwell regards belief. Sartwell defines belief according to the account R. B. Braithwaite's offers in <i>The Nature of Believing</i>. According to Braithwaite's account, for a subject <i>S</i> to hold the belief that <i>p</i>, the following two criteria must be met: 
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li>S entertains p</li>
        <li>S has a disposition to act as if p were true</li>
      </ol>

      <p>
        Sartwell uses the construction above to highlight two critical features of belief. The first feature is that the presence of (2) can quite often be observed in the absence (1). The example Sartwell cites to this extent is that of the gambler who closes his eyes, draws his finger to a horse on a racing form, and then bets the baby on that horse. The gambler's proposition that the horse will win, p, is not entertained in this instance but rather the gambler merely has disposition to bet on the horse. His disposition is simple: he's a gambler.  Perhaps if the gambler had some sort of complex statistical system then maybe he could entertain p and p would meet the criteria of belief. However, this brings into question deontological conceptions of justification of which Sartwell is not concerned. Thus, in this case we can say that the gambler simply had disposition. Disposition can come in many forms but only in the case that disposition aligns with <i>S</i> entertaining that <i>p</i> were actually true can we assert that <i>S</i> held the belief that <i>p</i>. 

      </p>
      <p> 
        The second critical feature of belief is that no belief stands in isolation.  Sartwell cites the case of a man who's brain is operated on by a mad scientist and the man awakes asserting that "Goldbach's conjecture is true". No evidence  but mere disposition stands in this case as well and it would seem that for the man to entertain the proposition that "Goldbach's conjecture is true" would be unjustified. Sartwell asserts that "I cannot have the belief that Goldbach's conjecture is true and fail to have any related beliefs" (158). Belief is a notion intertwined with a system of beliefs and merely asserting a true claim does not count as knowledge. If there is reason, or justification on the level of belief for the claim to be true, then it is possible to entertain the claim and form belief. However, as Sartwell points out: "If the claim is withdrawn as soon as it is brought into question... we may rightly say it was not believed".
      </p>

      <p>
        In conclusion to this section note: the typical inclination of the JTB+ advocate to criticize TB for including lucky gueseses in the scope of knowledge fails. A proposition must have some reason to be entertained to be considered a belief. Lucky guesses do not meet the criteria for belief in most cases. Thus, before passing a belief into any analysis of knowledge, such as TB, we need consider as a precursor the question: are we even dealing with an instance of a belief?
      </p>

      <h2>III. The Role of Justification: Truth-Conduciveness</h2>
      <p>
        The core of TB is to construe not that justification is an superfluous concept, but rather to conclude that justification should be construed as being merely of instrumental value to knowledge. Proper proof for this claim will follow in (IV), but for now I would like to highlight Sartwell's motivation for this view. Sartwell points out that an anecdotal account of theories of justification, from both coherentist and reliablist accounts, offer different methodologies in regards to the formation of beliefs. However, the critical convergence for all existing theories of justification is that they seek truth-conduciveness. Both internalist and externalist accounts of knowledge will concede that the purpose of justification is to provide methodology as to be truth-conducive.  Sartwell directly cites the coherentist Laurence Bonjour in saying:
      </p> 
      <blockquote>
        "If finding epistemically justified beliefs did not substantially increase the likelihood of finding true ones, epistemic justification would be irrelevant to our main cognitive goal and of dubious worth... epistemic justification is therefore in the final analysis only an instrumental value, not an intrinsic one". 
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        Sartwell additionally adds that while Bonjour explicitly states that justification is of mere instrumental value to knowledge, all proponents of justification implicitly concede that justification is of mere instrumental value as well. It must be the case that justification is of mere instrumental value to knowledge if justification is construed as having a purpose of solely conducing to the truth. Further, there are no accounts of justification that hold justification to be intrinsic to the value of knowledge. What then is left to theories of knowledge considering that hold justification is of instrumental value in conducing to the truth? Simply, that knowledge should be construed as merely true belief. And thus, with Sartwell's methodological and motivational components of TB now illustrated,  I will proceed to Sartwell's positive argument in favor of TB.
      </p>

      <h2>IV. Sartwell's Proof for TB: Why Knowledge is Merely True Belief</h2>
      <p>
        (I)-(III) established it now is appropriate to introduce Sartwell's proof for TB which he presents in <i>Why Knowledge is Merely True Belief</i>. Consider the my following reconstruction of Sartwell's argument for TB:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Knowledge is the goal of Inquiry (inquiry defined as: procedures that have their goal in generation of belief)</li>
        <li>Justification is a correct procedure for Inquiry</li>
        <li>Justification is a means to Knowledge<i>[From (1)-(2)]</i></li>
        <li>A proper specificiation of goal Y need not soley be defined by some means X</li>
        <li>Thus: Justification is only an instrumental component of Knowledge</li>
      </ol>


      <h2>V. A Response to Kvanig's Criticisms of TB: Reemphasizing TB's Telogology</h2>
      <p>
      Johathan Kvanig in an article entitled <i>The Value of Knowledge is External to It</i> attacks (1) arguing: "Is knowledge the goal of inquiry?... When we engage in inquiry we are trying to get to the truth about the subject matter in question. Inquiry ceases when we take ourselves to have found the truth". Kvanig contends that inquiry is intended to be truth-seeking rather than knowledge-seeking. Thus inquiry should be "directed at finding the truth" and trying to "avoid error".  So basically Kvanig feels that while Sartwell assumes that knowledge is the goal of inquiry, this assumption is not necesarilly grounded. Kvanig thinks that very generally <i>seeking the truth</i> and <i>avoiding anything that is not the truth</i> rather than simply <i>seeking knowledge</i> should be construed as the goal of inquiry.
      </p>

      <p>
      Sartwell indeed anticipates such counterobjection as Kvanig offers and concedes that (1) is un-defended. However, Sartwell notes that any teloelogical analysis of knowledge need make such inference.  An teloglocial analysis of inquiry is bound to such inclination and Sartwell poses the question that if <i>knowledge</i> is not the goal of inquiry or the epistemological telos then why a "tremendous emphasis has been placed on the theory of knowledge in the history of philosophy"? Further, Sartwell inquires what better goal might be construed for a normative teloelogial goal for inquiry in epistemology? 
      </p>
      <p>
      Along this vein, let us assume for sake of argument that instead of <i>knowledge</i> as Sartwell contends, <i>seeking truth and avoiding error</i> as Kvanig explicitly states is the telos or goal of inquiry. Under this view, we might suppose that truth may be reached in multiple courses instrumentally or directly. There can be multiple courses for inquiry that are all considered good actions conforming to reaching the goal of the truth and avoiding error.  The question now becomes: where is the line between which is of more important: seeking truth or avoiding error? Which of these goals is more important for inquiry? If they are both equally important then I see no reason why lucky guesses are any better than justified true beliefs in actions conforming to the telelogical goal of inquiry. If we were to assume epistemic agents had doxastic control over any beliefs why would flipping a coin not be a perfectly adequete method for inquiry? Although flipping a coin may not always avoid error, it will always seek the truth and flipping a coin will yield a 50% shot that error is avoided. Flipping a coin would still be inquiry just as much as forming a justified true belief because it considers both goal of inquiry and under one goal it may actually progress our inquiry: getting the truth.
      </p>

      <p>
      From this analysis I must conclude that Kvanig has a poor sense of what it is to have a telological normative analysis of knowledge. Kvanig conflates two goals within his telos of inquiry and thus crosses into the realm of deontology. In fact, seeking the truth and avoiding error is exactly what deontological theories of justification attempt to do. For example, a reliablist theory of justification seeks a similar goal as to what Kvanig's teloglocial goal for inquiry attempts to do. A reliablist theory of justification can be said to deliver true beliefs and avoid errors by way of providing the subject with only reliable methods of justification. Kvanig's problem is that he is asking too much of a teloglocial goal of inquiry. 
      
      Furthermore, Kvanig's analysis of what a telological goal of inquirymultiple need be construed as leaves little room for alternative methods of justification. Perhaps under some account of justification truth and falsity a valued equally. Coin flips are 

        As Sartwell puts it as: "I would ask my accusers at this point whether they can set out to analyze or describe without begging the question in favor of some such theory". Begging the question is an unavoidable question for both TB or any other teleological theory. Set X to be what your goal of inquiry is  and it will always be  possible that the motive for X can always be questioned. As such, outside of a deeper study on linguistics or virtue theory I believe no further inquiry need be intuited. I think any reply Kvanig gives along the lines that knowledge is not the goal of inquiry should be considered trivial in the epistemic teleological scope we are talking.
      </p>

      <p>
        (1) aside, Kvanig gives a seperate criticism of (4). Kvanig claims that while often (4) is granted, it is also sometimes the case that the means to something does in fact constitute a necessary component of its goal. Kvanig cites the example: "If becoming elected a senator is the result of a successful campaign, then running a successful campaign can be both a means to this goal and a constituent as well" (42). Kvanig adds that while Sartwell wishes to claim that a means to a goal does not make said means necessary for a goal, in many cases means toward a goal are both necessary and sufficient for achieving that goal. Kvanig cites a second example that a means toward getting a million dollars is "getting a half a million, or getting nine hundred thousand, or getting the first dollar" in claiming "means can be necessary constituent of the goal in question".
      </p>

      <p>
      In regards to Kvanig's criticisms he provides in rejection of (4), again I must appeal to the telological nature of Sartwell's argument. Sartwell's argument is <i>not</i> intended to be concerned with means as so much it is concerned with the goal of inquiry generally.  Thus, I am not sure if Kvanig's critisisms he provides in rejection of (4) holds any ground as posed teleologically and normativly so much as posed descriptivly and deontologically.  As mentioned in (II), determining what the means to get to a goal are is a perfectly legitimate cocern for a <i>deontological</i> epistemological project. However, again, Sartwell is not concerned with constructing a deontological epistemological project. Sartwell's goal is to provide the general telogolical framework for an analysis of knowledge. In doing so, with (4) he is merely pointing out that justification currenelty serves as one means in confroming to the goal of inquiry. 
      </p>

      <p>Thus, we find that in (4) and additionally as in (1), Kvanig misunderstand the normative telological scope of Sartwell's argument. A teleological theory as explored in (II) need adhere to the end goals <i>rather</i> than the means. However, a deontological or descriptive theory can be a component of a teleological normative theory. As such, these questions are left in deontological theories of justification. 
      </p>

      <p>
      One further point I would like to make in light of Kvanig's criticisms offer to TB is that: Sartwell's positive proof for TB absolutly imports the dependency of being normative in its analytical sense. Sartwell's first paper, <i>Knowledge is Merely True Belief</i>, does not contend to offer <i>any</i> sense in which such formulation is proposed outside of an looking at an ancedtoal account of knowledge. What I mean by this is simply that Sartwell's argument is not pure postive proof that knowledge is true belief in some sort of pre-analytic sense in which Kvanig wishes to bestow upon TB. Much argumentation can take Sartwell's positive proof for TB as found in <i>Why Knowledge is True Belief</i> in isolation and point out critical failings of TB's inductive nature. I cannot argue against these criticisms directly, but simply I must refer the reader to undertsand that Sartwell's argument is best and only should be taken in the conjuction of both of his papers.
      </p>


      <h2>VI. A Response to Lycan's Criticism of TB: Reemphasizing TB's Normativity</h2>

      <p>
        In an article entitled <i>Sartwell's Minimalist Analysis of Knowledge</i>, William Lycan criticizes TB in a deduction by showing that if one believes TB and further that if we assume for reductio that TB is in fact true then we can derive by way of TB that one could <i>know TB</i>. Lycan presents his proof as:
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li>Sartwell believes TB. [Premise; I presume he is sincere]</li>
        <li>TB is true. [Assumption for <i>reductio</i>]</li>
        <li>If TB is true, then whoever believes truly that P, knows that P. [Trivial, given what TB says.]</li>
        <li>If (1) and (2), then Sartwell knows TB. [From (3).]</li>
        <li>Thus: Sartwell knows TB. [(1), (2), (4).]</li>
      </ol>

      <p>
      In response to Lycan, we must question the motivation to which Lycan would posed such critism of a normative analysis of knowledge to begin with. Namely, we should question Lycan's assumption for reductio, (2). While I do concede that one could hold a sincere disposition to a normative philosophical claim, I do not think that (2) or for that matter any normative claim could be entertained in the manner of belief for which TB being a normative philosophical analysis of knowledge is designed. TB is not a descriptive theory that is designed in itself to handle descriptive critique. TB is a formalized account of a <i>normative proposition</i> designed to handle and normativly make sense of other <i>descriptive propositions</i> or <i>normative propositions</i>. Although, I use the terminology that TB is a normative <i>theory</i> rather than <i>proposition</i> prior to this section, a theory can just as easy be seen to have propositional content. However, if we consider any normative theory to have propositional content or rather render a normative theory <i>as</i> a normative proposition, the sense in which such statement can be propositional is different than the sense in which a descriptive statement can be propositional. Intuitivly viewed, the truth of a normative prosition is adhere to such that the truth of a normative proposition can only ever be <i>normative</i> rather than descriptivly true.  For deeper explaintion of this difference, let us recall Braithwaite's account of belief as explained in (II). According to Braithewaite's account of belief, some subject S believes that p if and only if both:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>S entertains p</li>
        <li>S has a disposition to act as if p were true</li>
      </ol>

      <p>
      For both descriptive propositions and normative propositions, the sense in which S might enertains that p were true in Braithewaite's account of belief can be applied positivly in either case. However, the key difference between the application of "entertaining" a proposition normativly versus descriptivly is the sense in which the truth is referenced. For a descriptive proposition the truth is unquestionable, apparent, and unwaivering. Things are how they are because it would be absurd to think of them as any other way. Descriptive propositions are just that, they appeal to the truth in that they describe things in reference to the truth of how they descriptivly are. Descriptive propositions are to be taken <i>at face value</i> rather than in some deeply analytic sense.  On the other hand, a normative proposition handles the truth in a difference sense. A normative proposition can only be true in so far as it is true in virtue of the subjective nature of its believer. A normative proposition is designed to provide a subjectivly good <i>model</i> for understanding the truth of other propositions (whether the other propositions are normative or descriptive in nature). To get a better sense of this distinction between descriptive and normative propositions let us consider an example of a way in which some proposition could be considered in either category descriptive or normative. Any proposition can technically pre-analytically be classified in either category; however, intuitivly certain propositions naturally fall in one category. Consider the proposition p to be: "the door is red".
      </p>
      <p>
      At its face value this proposition that the door is red, p, seems like it would be descriptive at face value in its propositional value. As such, if you were to put two subjects in a room together and one subject were to state p, it would seem seem absurd for the other subject to deny that p positivly. If there is a sense in which both subjects can understand red, the question of whether the door is actually red or not is not of concern. The one subject stating that p, is simply describing that it is apparent descriptivly that p is the case.
      </p>

      <p>
      However, if you take this same proposition, the door is red, on the normative level then another level of analysis can be applied. Again, normative analysis is concerend with providing a <i>model</i> rather than the apparent description of the way things are. Thus, if one subject were to state p and the other subject were to interpret p normativly rather than descriptivly a new set of questions could be asked. p could always be rendered true or false normativly if the model which p falls into seems insufficient to the judging subject. So there is a diminished sense of "truth" in any proposition that is claimed to be normative. Regardless however, this is why you don't hear very often of propositional analsyis of normative claims. Or rather, it is contradictory in one sense to interpret any statement within a normative propositional construal.
      </p>

      <p>
      This explained, it should seem apparent why Lycan's critism wholly seems insufficient or to be any serious problem for TB. TB is a normative <i>theory</i>. No where in either <i>Knowledge is Merely True Belief</i> or in <i>Why Knowledge is Merely True Belief</i> does Sartwell propose that TB should be taken as anything more than a theory. Theories can be viewed as normative in propositional value, however I am not sure it is progressive to the sense in which any theory is ment to take form that it be viewed propositionally. While in (IV) I offer a seemingly descriptive construction of Sartwell's TB as I preface in sections (I)-(III) such description is to be taken with normative value. Lycan proposing that we should be able to descriptivly plug the normative claim of TB into TB itself and expect any result by another normative proposition back is absurd. Yes, Sartwell may "know" that TB is true. HOwever, the sense in which Sartwell knows this to be the case is not a descriptive "know" but a normative "know".
      </p>
      
      <h2>VII. But Gettier Cases are Not Knowledge</h2>
      <p>
        I would like to introduce a potential objection which I have not found argued against Sartwell explicitly in the literature, but surely it is present. The objection I speak of is that of the JTB+ advocate arguing: "Gettier cases cannot be instances of knowledge". The JTB+ advocate will likely balk at TB solely for the reason that it seems intuitively wrong to call Gettier cases instances of knowledge.
      </p>


      <p>
        Consider the classical Gettier case: Jones' boss tells him that the man who will get the job has ten coins in his pocket. Further, Jones has the evidence that Smith has ten coins in his pocket. On these two pieces of evidence, Jones forms the belief that p: the man who will get the job has ten coins in his pocket. As it turns out, Jones' boss has deceived him and it is not Smith who will get the job but Jones himself. Jones gets the job and looks in his pocket and as it turns out he has ten coins in his pocket. Did Jones know that p?
      </p>

      <p>
        A JTB+ advocate would surely deny that Jones knew that p. However, why is it relevant or of any epistemological importance to deny Jones the knowledge that p? Is not the ultimate epistemological goal truths? What is our motive in caring to be right for the right epistemological reasons?  The Gettier case I feel truly reveals the beauty of TB. On TB, Jones can know that p but at the same time not be justified that p.  Whether or not Jones is justifed that p will likely solely rest on which theory of justification Jones adheres to. Maybe on some justificatory theory A, Jones is justified in p and on justificatory theory B Jones is not justified in p. However, knowledge is not the question Gettier should have initially concerned himself with. If we were to interview Jones and ask him if he did know that p, he would likely reply, "Surprisingly, I did!". 
      </p>

      <p>
        The Gettier case illustrates an interesting observation for the distinction between knowledge and justification. While justification is relatively subjective in that depending on which theory of justification you adhere to, whether you were justified that p can vary. As such, the narcissist Jones will likely concede that of course he was justified in p, while the meek Jones may say no I wasn't justified that p. However, knowledge is not and should not be as forgiving. Outside of the field of philosophical epistemological endeavors I think it would be rather absurd to claim that Jones didn't have knowledge of some true belief. While the Gettier case and my explanation may seem like begging the question for TB, I think accepting a theory of knowledge ultimate boils down how exactly "knowledge" is referred to anecdotally.
      </p>

      <h2>VIII. Sartwell's View of Knowledge in Language</h2>

      <p>
        Sartwell in <i>Knowledge is Merely True Belief</i> introduces TB largely by way of making claims paralleling a TB analysis of knowledge to the way "knowledge" is referred to in everyday language. I think this is an incredibly interesting point Sartwell makes for TB and a large part of both of his articles can be seen as a appeal to language in such regard. In natural and common language when somebody claims to have knowledge of a claim it means that they truly believe the claim. Everyday people do not think, how do I know this, or why do I know this or why am I justified? Rather, when a knower claims that they know that p and are challenged about their knowledge that p, only then is justification considered.

        Thus justification in language is instrumental. Justification provides us a way to confirm and assess both: 1. Whether the claimant actually entertains the belief that p and 2. What their justification was in forming the belief that p.  As Sartwell puts it in <i>Knowledge is Merely True Belief</i>, TB is an appeal to "what we would say" and further he holds that "This is not because I hold that ordinary language is invariably a good guide to meaning... but simply because the only arguments which appear to demand a serious response are framed in terms of linguistic practice".

      <h2>IX. The Pragmatism of Epistemological Minimalism</h2>

      <p>
        In conclusion, epistemological minimalistic or accepting that knowledge is merely true belief can be seen essentially as a recipe for epistemological pragmatism. Speculating on what knowledge is beyond so far as what is true belief is a question that is solely a concern within the field of epistemology. As we have seen in (VIII) if you consider Sartwell's appeal to language, TB is the most accurate analysis of knowledge in such regard.

        Sartwell does not concede the project on which he embarks explicitly as "pragmatism" however I do think that is the term which best describes TB. Epistemological minimalism seeks to be pragmatic in that is pushes justification into a separate domain of epistemology. Mainly it acknowledges that while justification may not be able to provide concrete answers for subject S being justified that p, we can provide a definition for what it is for subject S to know that p. Further, in fact the reason that we can provide that definition of subject S knowing that p is that anecdotally this is already how we view "knowledge" in language.
      </p>

      <p>
        One final note is that while epistemological minimalism pushes for pragmatism in so far as knowledge is concerned, it allows for debates of justification to remain intact. Is justification best a coherentist or a reliabalist conception? The answer to that question we are not sure of but both can co-exist under the umbrella of TB. TB provides a level of minimalism and pragmatism that doesn't impend on the projects of justification and other essential parts of the epistemological field while it halts debate where it need be halted.
