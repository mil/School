    <div id="title">In Defence of Sartwell's True Belief Analysis of Knowledge</div>
    <div class="response">
      <p>
        Gettier cases have spawned a whole slew of theories tacking on an additional criteria for to the justified true belief (JTB) analysis of knowledge. As such, in epistomology the view that is often endorsed as the solution to the Gettier problem is that knowledge <i>is atleast justified true belief</i> (JTB+). Another approach to the Gettier problem is to consider knowledge to be merely true belief (<i>TB</i>) as presented by Crispin Sartwell in <i>Knowledge is Merely True Belief</i> and <i>Why Knowledge is Merely True Belief</i>. TB is not an antecdote for epistomological anaarchy but rather suggest that justification is merely instrumental to knowledge. TB avoids the Gettier problem all together by actually including Gettier cases as cases of knowledge. Proceeding, I will firstly analyze the motivation and argument for Sartwell's <i>TB</i> (I-III), secondly I will present my reconstruction of Sartwell's argumnt in favor of TB (IV), thirdly I will refute criticisms directed at <i>TB</i> (V-VI), and concluding I will offer additional explanation of why counter-argumentation of TB is bound to fail by re-emphasizing the key methodology Sartwell takes in the development of <i>TB</i> (VV).
      </p>

      <h2>I. The Scope of an Analysis of Knowledge: Teleological and Normative</h2>
      <p>
        In the face of Gettier, the intuition for the epistomologist is to morph JTB into JTB+ rather than skin JTB into TB.  Understaning Sartwell's motivation for the latter over the former lies in realizing that taking either route will affect not only how we think about our analysis of what knowledge is, but additionally, how we answer the question of: what the value of knowledge is? Sartwell's view for TB sufficiently addresses both these interests, however without taking both of his articles (<i>Knowledge is Merely True Belief</i> and <i>Why Knowledge is Merely True Belief</i>) into consideration it is easy to misunderstand Sartwell's argument. As such, following I wish to establish a few methodological points that are quintesential to Sartwell's proposal for TB before introducing Sartwell's proof for TB outright. Taking these methodological considerations into account will help the reader understand Sartwell's motivation, design, and ultimate goal for which TB aims.  Proceeding - although only stressed in Sartwell's second article, <i>Why Knowledge is Merely True Belief</i>, considering the distinctions between both: telelogical versus deontological and normative versus descriptive epistomlogical projects is critical to understanding the scope of Sartwell's argument. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Firstly: a telelogical epistomological project should seek very generally to understand the ends and ultimate goals of knowledge. This is in contrast with a deonotological project which should seek to understand the methodological processes of belief forming and how we can obtain knowledege in terms of everday action. Sartwell concerns TB as heading solely in the direction of a telelogoical conception of knowledge and not at all bridging into deontology. Further, Sartwell notes that a purely deontological analysis of knowledge is bound to fail in the same way a purely deonotological ethical system will fail. An analysis of knowledge which fails to discern a source for our epistemic obligations seems to not be in line with the overarching goal of epistomology. It is apparent teleology and deontology are not mutually exclusive concepts and they must somehow overlap, however it will suffice to accept that an analysis of epistemic knowledge should be concerned soley with knowledge in its teleological reagrd.
      </p>

      <p>
        Secondly: a normative project should address the philosophical questions of epistomology such as: "How should we generate beliefs with regard to achieving knowlege? How should inquiry  be conducted and evaluated? And what, exactly, is its goal, i.e., what is knowledge?". These kinds of normative questions are in contrast to descriptive epistomology which is essentially an extension of psychology or cognitive science that seeks to determine identifying reliable belief forming processes or seeking out the cognitive mechanisims involved in the generation of belief and formation knowledge. As such, Sartwell seeks for a normative project in his analysis of knowledge over a descriptive project which is not at all in line with an epistemological analysis of knowledge.
      </p>

      <p>
        Sartwell provides an in depth analysis of this epistomological taxonomy (teleological/deontological and normative/descriptive) which he chooses to work. Sartwell's taxonomoy is largely modeled after a parallel to ethical systems developed by William Alston and he concedes to work stricly in a normative and teleological framework. Many of the shortcomings of epistomological theories of knowledge along the lines of JTB/JTB+ can be seen as failings in distinguishing what is teleological versus what is deontological. It is obvious the two are interwined in a complex fashion, however for now it will suffice for me to simply emphasize that Sartwell is strictly concerned with a teleological normative analysis of knowledge. 
      </p>


      <h2>II. A Primer on Belief: Can a Lucky Guess be Knowledge?</h2>

      <p>One of the initial concerns for TB somebody asserting JTB+ might bring forth is that it seems incoherent to build a specification of knowledge without any sort of justification because on such an account lucky guesses could easily be countered as knowledge. To this sort of argument it is essential we analyze the way in which Sartwell regards belief. Sartwell defines belief according to the account R. B. Braithwaite's offers in <i>The Nature of Believing</i>. According to Braithwaite's account, for a subject <i>S</i> to hold the belief that <i>p</i>, the following two criteria must be met: 
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li>S entertains p</li>
        <li>S has a disposition to act as if p were true</li>
      </ol>

      <p>
        Sartwell uses the construction above to highlight two critical features of belief. The feature is that the presence of (2) can quite often be observed in the asbecence of the presence of (1). The example Sartwell cites to this extent is that of the gambler who closes his eyes, draws his finger to a horse on a racing form, and then bets the baby on that horse. The gambler does not have a belief in that he can entain that p is actually true. However, the gambler does have diposition to assent and bet on the horse. Disposition can come in many forms, however only in the case that disposition aligns with <i>S</i> entertaining that <i>p</i> were actually true can we make claims about <i>S</i>'s belief that <i>p</i>. 
      </p>
      <p> 
        The second critical feature of belief is that no belief stands in isolation.  Sartwell cites the case of a man who's brain is operated on by a mad scientist and awakes asserting that "Goldbach's conjecture is true". No evidence  but mere disposition to assent stands in this case again and it would seem that for the man to hold the belief that "Goldbach's conjecture is true" would be unjustified. Sartwell asserts that "I cannot have the belief that Goldbach's conjecture is true and fail to have any related beliefs" (158). Belief is a notion intertwined with a ssytem of beliefs and merely asserting a true claim does not count as knowledge. If there is reason, or justification on the level of belief for the claim to be true, then it is possible to entertain the claim and form beleif.  Sartwell points out that if "If the claim is withdrawn as soon as it is brought into question... we may rightly say it was not believed".
      </p>


      <h2>III. The Role of Justification: Truth-Conduciveness</h2>
      <p>
        The core of TB does not suggest that justification is an superflous concept, but rather suggest that justification should be construed as being merely of instrumental value to knowledge. The motivation behind this view Sartwell developes through an ancedtoal account of theories of justification. Theory of justification, from both coherentist or reliablist account, offer different methodologies in regards to the formation of beliefs. However, the critical convergence for all existing theories of justificaiton is that they seek truth-conuciveness. Both internalist and externalist accounts of knowledge will concede that the purpose of justification is to provide methodology as to be truth-conducive.  Sartwell directly cites the coherentist Launche Bonjour as in saying, "If finding epistemically justified beliefs did not substainally increase the likelihood of finding true ones, epistemic justification would be irrelevant to our main cognitive goal and of dubous worth... epistemic justifcation is therefore in the final analysis only an instrumental value, not an intrinsic one". 
      </p>
      <p>
        Sartwell additionally adds that while Bonjour explicitly states that justification is of mere instrumental value to knowledge, all proponents of justification implicilty concede that justification is of mere instrumental value as well. It must be the case that justification is of mere instrumental value to knowledge if justification is construed to conduce to the truth. What then is left of a theory of knowledge that has an instrumental component seeking to conducing to the truth? Simply, knowledge should be construed as merely true belief. And thus, I will proceed to Sartwell's argument in favor of TB.
      </p>

      <h2>IV. Sartwell's Proof for TB: Why Knowledge is Merely True Belief</h2>
      <p>
        I-III established it now is appropriate to introduce Sartwell's proof for TB which he presents in <i>Why Knowledge is Merely True Belief</i>. Consider the my following recostruction of Sartwell's argument for TB:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Knowledge is the goal of inquiry (inquiry defined as: procedures that have their goal in generation of belief)</li>
        <li>Justification is defined as a correct procedure for inquiry</li>
        <li>[From 1-2] Justification is a means to true belief</li>
        <li>X being a means to goal Y does not make X a necessary component of Y</li>
        <li>Thus: Justification is only an instrumental component of knowledge</li>
      </ol>

      <p>
        (1) seems to be the most vulnerable premise as it seems to beg the question and Sartwell indeed concedes to this effect: "I have not gone very far to establish that point" (174). Though, Sartwell adds that, a theory of knowledge is bound to such inclination and he poses that if knowledge is not the goal of inquiry or the epistomological telos then why has so much "tremendous emphasis been place on the theory of knowledge in the history of philosophy". Further he inquires what better goal might be construed for a normative account of epistomology?
      </p>


      <h3>Kvanig's Critism of TB</h3>

      <p>
        Johathan Kvanig in an article entitled <i>The Value of Knowledge is External to it</i> indeeds attacks (1) arguing: "Is knowledge the goal of inquiry?... When we engage in inquiry we are trying to get to the truth about the subject matter in question. Inquiry ceases when we take ourselves to have found the truth". Kvanig adds that inquiry is intended to be truth-seeking rather than knowledge-seeking and to that extent that knowledge's purpose is meant to find truths and avoid errors. Kvanig goes on to attack (4), saying that while often (4) is granted, it is also sometimes the case that the means to something does in fact constitue a necessary a component of its goal. Kvanig cites the example: "If becoming elected a senator is the result of a sucessful campaign, then running a successful campaign can be both a means to this goal and a constituent as well" (42). Kvanig adds that while Sartwell wishes to claim that a means to a goal does not make said means necessary for a goal, in many cases soem means toward a goal are both necessary and sufficient for achieving that goal. Kvanig cites a second example that a means toward getting a million dollars is "getting a half a milllion, or getting nine hundred thousand, or getting the first dollar" in claiming "means can be necssary constituent of the goal in question".
      </p>
      <p>
        In response to Kvanig's attack of (1) I would like to re-emphasize Sartwell's position on the matter. (1) is in fact un-defended by Sartwell however it is a necessary component of his view. Any analysis of knowledge need make such inference. Kvanig emphasizes that inquiry seeks truth and ceases when the truth is found. Further that inquiry is such that "directed at finding the truth and "avoiding error"". The problem with Kvanig's point here is that he fails to grant any degree of charity to Sartwell's view. Criqutquing Sartwell's argument in saying that inquiry must find the truth and avoid error begs the question for JTB+ in the same way that TB begs the question in saying knowledge that the goal of inquiry. Neither is a completely logical claim and as Sartwell puts it "I would ask my accusers at this point whtether they can set out to analyze or describe without begging the question in favor of some such theory". Thus, begging the question is unavoidable in such discourse and Kvanig's line of begging the question is no better than Sartwell's. Outside of a study on linguistics I think this point need not be defended any further.
      </p>
      <p>
        One short note before commenting on Kvanig's critism of (4), Kvanig misinterprets from my reconstruction of Sartwell's argument (4) as: "Nothing that is merely a means to a goal is a necessary component of that goal" (42). This is not at all the stance Sartwell takes and I would refer the reader to the text in which Sartwell argues: "it is incoherent to build a specification of something regarded merely as a means of acheving some goal into the description of the goal itself". I surely am inclined to think that Sartwell was not attempting to assert earth-shattering ties between the connection of means and goals. As such, I do believe my (4) to be interpreatoin of Sartwell than Kvanig provides. Kvanig's position is obviously a strawman and as such it quickly dissolves in the face of counter-example. Kvanig asserts two counter-examples in which means to a certain goal are in fact a necessary component of the goal itself such to draw analogy to justification-knowledge connection. He never explicitly states that the connection between justification and knowledge is necessary but rather contends that such position is mistaken. For argument's sake if we grant that Kvanig was not pulling a strawman, his analogies in both examples fail to fit. As such the senator's who win's the race means and constituent to the goal to run a successful camapgin? What about if the senator rigs the election? Or how about if the senator simply kills all members of the opposing party in town? Even if we grant Kvanig's example it fails to prove his point. What about getting one, ten, or a half a million dollars in order to get a million dollars? Well I would simply not say that Kvanig here has provided a relevant example of the justifcation-knowledge relation. This is simply a poor analogy of a  goal with a singular means necessary as to reject the inference from (3-4) to (5) prima facie. In anycase, I do not believe Kvanig to have done his homework and properly given Sartwell any sufficient level of charity necessary to draw his inferences. Kvanig cited the article as being falacious from the point of view of somebody that had already made up their mind that TB could not be the case.

      <h3>Lycan's Criticism of TB</h3>

      <p>
        In an article entitled <i>Sartwell's Minimalist Analysis of Knowledge</i>, William Lycan critisizes TB in a deduction by showing that if one believes TB and further that if we assume for reductio that TB is in fact true then we can derive by way of TB that one could <i>know TB</i>. Lycan presents his proof as:
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li>Sartwell believes TB. [Premise; I presume he is sincere]</li>
        <li>TB is true. [Assumption for <i>reductio</i></li>
        <li>If TB is true, the whoever believes truly that P, knows that P. [Trivial, given what TB says.]</li>
        <li>If (1) and (2), then Sartwell knows TB. [From (3).]</li>
        <li>Thus: Sartwell knows TB. [(1), (2), (4).]</li>
      </ol>

      <p>
        My inclination in response to Lycan is to question his assumption for reductio, (2). While I do concede that one can hold a sincere disposition to a philosophical claim, I do not think that (2) or for that matter any teleological claim could said to have propositional value. Asserting that one could ever possibly know a philosophical analaysis in terms of propositional content is absurd. And indeed Lycan himself concedes that in the case of <i>knowledge</i> that "it is unlikely that anyone <i>knows</i> any highly controversial philosophical claim to be true, and it is unlikely that Sartwell is so arrogant to believe he knows TB in particular. This highlights the critical failing of Lycan's argument against TB: Lycan's deduction is a matter of fitting the wrong kind of belief into TB and then critisizing its outputs. Additionally, I question wheter (1) would be accepted on Sartwell's analysis of belief. Although Sartwell may hold a strong disposition to assent for TB, how could Sartwell ever entertain TB as being "true" outside of his own philosophical workings?  Along the same lines in which Lycan offer his "ugly consequence from TB" equally ugly consequences could be dervied of a JTB+ system:
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li>Lycan believes JTB+</li>
        <li>JTB+ is true and justified. [Assumption for <i>reductio</i></li>
        <li>If JTB+ is true and justified, then whoever believes truely that P and is justified that P, knows that P</li>
        <li>If (1) and (2), then Sartwell knows TB. [From (3).]</li>
        <li>Thus: Lycan knows JTB+ [From (1), (2), (4)]</li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        And thus, the same commentary Lycan provides in critisim of TB applied to a theory of JTB+. This highlight Lycan's mis-application of a analysis of knowledge to a teleological philosophical claim. Does this highlight some sort of massive failing of prospects of analyses of knowledge?  I think not -- however it does bring back in to light the quintessential point Sartwell provides in precusor to his positve account for TB in <i>Why Knowledge is Mere True Beleif</i> that we should be aiming strictly for a normative teleological analysis of knowledge.
      </p>


      <h3>III. On Gettier and the True Belief Analysis of Knowledge</h3>

      <p>As I touched on initially at the begining of this paper, construing knowledge as merely true belief can be seen as as an alternative in the oppositve direction to JTB+X analyses take to solving the Gettier problem.
        in light as the traditional ways those asserting knowledge to be at least justified true belief offer. The opponent of the true belief analysis of knowledge may claim that the Gettier case highlights the fundamental defficiency of TB. As such, since on TB, Gettier cases are considered knowledge it seems that intuitivly TB must be faulty. Sartwell would likely reply that this kind of view misses the point all together. If looked at from the stance of TB, justification is in fact present in Gettier cases, however it is apparent that 
      </p>

      <p>An intersting effect of constring knowledge to be merely true belief is that Gettier cases cease to be a relevant problem. The insufficiency of the JTB analysis of knowledge highlights why the Gettier case makes such a positive account for a true belief theory of knowledge. Epistomologists construing knowledge to be <i>at least justified true belief</i>do so by altering the sense in which a theory is said to be justified or a belief is such that it concedes to the truth. While in the Gettier case it is apparent that justifciation is present, in that Jones had good evidence, or justification, in forming the belief which happened to be true, it is incredibly diffucult to say why Jones does not have knowledge.
      </p>
      <p>
        An interesting consequence of asserting that knowledge is merely true belief as Sartwell does is that the Gettier problem seems to fade as a problem. However, it is not that Sartwell's analysis of knowledge solves the Gettier problem by way of adding additional criteria as proponents viewing that knowledge is atleast justified true belief does, but rather on the true belief analysis of knowledge Gettier cases are in fact cases of knowledge. So when Jones truely believe that the man who will get the Job has ten coins in his pocket then he actually does know this to be the case. Is this a problematic concern for Sartwell? No -- it is just telling about the extensivity of the true belief analysis of knowledge. Stephen Hetherington offers an interesting critque of the the true belief analysis of knowledge in which he mis-interprets the Gettier problem as being problematic for Sartwell. In a Gettier case, justification is present in any account and Sartwell would likely agre
      </p>

      <h3>IV. Criticisms of TB</h3>
      <p>
        There are far too many critisms of TB in the literature to survey each critism individually. As such, I will try to categorize critisims of TB into  several categories. It is seemingly diffucult to agree with the thesis which TB asserts when weighted against the historical analysis of knowledge as being JTB. However it is important to consider in these critisms.
      </p>

      <p>
        If true belief is the goal of inquiry, justification is only instrumental to inquiry.  The essential idea at play is that while justification is a sufficient criteria for knowledge it is not a necessary criteria. Knowledge is just true belief. This is not to say that justification is of no epistemological significance. Justification gives general procedures for inquiry to true belief and establishes standards for evaluating inquiry. However, justification is not intrinsic to knowledge but rather instrumental. I wish to explain Sartwell's goals in establishing a true belief analysis of knowledge and further support such analysis as superior to the JTB analysis of knowledge.
      </p>

      <p>
        A way of thinking about Sartwell's claim that knowledge merely true belief is to consider justification as happening at the level of belief rather than at the level of <i>knowledge</i>. As it so turns out justification is a necessary process at some point in fufilling the criteria of knowledge. For Gettier cases this introduce an interesting implication, mainly that for TB, simply a true belief is justified. If one were to accept

        * Motive to love of the truth -- inquiry?
        * Why is it not desirable to know certain things such as dinosaur ex...


        Another essential part of Sartwell's argument is that while he wishes show justification as instrumental to knowledge, he is by no means seeking out epistomological anarchy or asserting that justification has no purpose. In an article by Linda Zagzebski, Zagzebski proscribes an alternative approach to the analysis of knowledge in looking to differentiate what distinguishes true belief from knowledge. She uses the agent-actor model to show the way we must look at knowledge is having two properties: desirability and admirability. She feels that if a true belief is both admirable and desirable then the knowledge is more valuable than a true belief that is not admirable and not desirable. However, this analysis of the value of true beliefs has issues as well and as Zagzebksi puts it, it introduce a new style Gettier problem. It is such that if the true belief's admirability and desirability is not linked or due to some relevant factor there is a problem that is introduced. Zagzebski called this problem the new style Gettier problem. This is solved by the notions of admirable and desirability being linked together by some factor. An example of a belief that is admirable and desirable is that of the math teacher who has learned of the pythagroeon theorm through the extesnive study of mathematics. For the teacher that has learned so has a belief that is desirable and admirable in its acquistion.  However the notion of desirablity serves to eliminate Gettier cases from Zagzebski's analysis of value. The notion of desirability sets it so that only beliefs that are formed by good de-ontological action are desirable. So desirability impends on the prospect of a new style Gettier problem.

      </p>


      <p>
        Sartwell proceeds in his argument by bringing knowledge into question from a linguist level as well. Sartwell asserts justification is mainly linguistically provided in cases when somebody poses the question in face of a portrayed beliefe: "How do you know?". In most when faced with the justification requestion, if no justification can be given it can't be said that the claimainst actually knew. However it is in intersting fact about such request in that request for justification only ever makes sense in cases in which there is un-certentity wheter the claim is in fact true. If a belief has already been proven true asking for justification is superfluous. Additionally, while even in cases where justifcation is inded superflous it seems the request for justification is still valid if the belief is not assume true by both parties. As such "how do you know?" can always be asked to ascertain of the rationale of the supposed knower. However, when asked the question "how do you know?" there is a point at which no more justification need be given in that "the demand for justification will eventually be rejected with regard to some proposition embedded in the justificaiton of the original claim". Sartwell uses the example of a child questioning the claim his parent provided that "elephants have trunks". The child's parent could justify this claim for quite a while when asked reptivivly "how do you know", by telling the child that he has seen pictures of elephants with trunks or have even seen actual elephants with trunks, and so on. However, at some point it seems the justification request must be denied. The point Sartwell wishes to make is that regardless of an epistemological analysis of knowledge, from a linguistic persepective knowledge is best construed as merely true belief. In light of this linguist analysis of knowledge, Sartwell provides several counter-examples to JTB+ as to show JTB+'s own deficienies.
      </p>

      <p>
        I won't go into detail on Sartwell's counter-examples to JTB+, however I will emphasize the relevant conclusion Sartwell reaches at the end of <i>Knolwedge is Merely True Belief</i> and what could be said to be Sartwell's purpose of the article.       </p>

      <p>
        Adding to Sartwell's analysis of justification and knowledege from the linguist level Sartwell comments that when somebody asks the question "how do you know" of a claimaint, two distinct motives are conflated in such conjecture. The first motive for ask the claimant how they know something is that the inquierer is trying to assess whtether the claimnt does in fact know their belief or whether they merely hold their belief. Secondly, the questioner may be trying to assess the overall rationality of the claimianst and further assess their justification in thei belief. As such, for Sartwell, justification in linguistics again proves not to be a superflous abstraction or of no epistomological bearning but rather just an instrumental component of knowledge. Sartwell is in no way pushing in the direction of an epistemological anarchism by claiming that knowledge is true belief but rather just looking to question from a normative teleological conception, the way we thinka about knowledge. Accordingly, Sartwell's first paper can be seen not as concrete proof of epistemological minimalism, but rather just as a rehash and critical evaluation of the problem of the tie between justifciation and knowledge.
