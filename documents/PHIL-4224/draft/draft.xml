    <div class="response">
      <p>
        Traditional epistemological analyses of knowledge assert knowledge to be justified true belief.  However, such analysis are problematic in light of the classical Gettier case such that: Suppose Jones forms the belief <i>p</i> that: the man who will get the job has 10 coins in his pocket. Additionally, Jones holds <i>p</i> on the well-founded evidence that he knows: 1. Smith will get the job and 2. Smith has 10 coins in his pocket. Then, it turns out that Smith does not get the job, but rather Jones himself gets the job and has 10 coins in his own pocket. In this case, <i>p</i> satifies JTB, however epistomologists often say it seems intuitively wrong to say that Jones knew that <i>p</i>. Gettier cases spawned a whole slew of theories tacking on an additional criteria for knowledge to JTB.  Another approach to the Gettier problem is to consider knowledge to be merely true belief as presented by Crispin Sartwell in <i>Knowledge is Merely True Belief</i> and <i>Why Knowledge is Merely True Belief</i>. This a minimimal analysis of knowledge, considering mere true belief to constittue knowledge, avoids the Gettier problem all together. If it turns out Jones gets the job, then Jones actually did know that <i>p</i>. Proceeding, I will firstly analyze the motivation and argument for Sartwell's minimal analysis of knowledge, secondly refute criticisms directed at Sartwell's analysis of knowledge, and finally offer additional counter-argumentation which may arise in the face of a minimalist analysis of knowledge.
      </p>

      <h2>I. Entertaining the Possibility that Knowledge is Merely True Belief</h2>
      <p>
        In Sartwell's first article, <i>Knowledge is Merely True Belief</i>, he does not a concrete "proof" that knowledge is merely true belief but rather offers a persuasive case for considering knowledge to be true belief. He does this by firstly providing several counter-examples to TB that will likely be asserted by someone arguing that JTB+. He then uses these examples to show that when his opponents question the validity of <i>TB</i>, intutitive counter-examples often do not even suffice as being instances of belief. Defining what constitues belief is an essential component of dismissing potential counter-examples to TB. Sartwell defines belief according to the account R. B. Braithwaite's offers in <i>The Nature of Believing</i>. According to Braithwaite's account, for a subject S to hold the belief that p, the following two criteria must be met: 
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>S entertains p</li>
        <li>S has a disposition to act as if p were true</li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        Sartwell provides 4 counter-examples which seem to obviously pass on JTB+ but fail on TB. Sartwell then shows that the reason that the counter-examples seem to fail for TB is not due to their lack of justification, but rather due to their inability to simply meet the requirement of belief. The point Sartwell wishes to make with his counter-examples is that disposition to assent is very commonplace to occur and appear prima facie as belief in the absence of actually entertaining and holding a belief. Proceeding, I will reconstruct two of Sartwell's aformentoined counter-examples to TB and show how while they may suffice (2), they will suffice (1). The first example I will provide is that of a gambler that closes his eyes, puts his finger on a horse on a racing form, and then conseqeuntly bets the baby on that horse. Surely in this case, the gambler may have a dispotion to assent that the horse will win the race and thus fufill (2), however, how could the gambler be said to truly entertain the belief p: that the horse would win? Perhaps if the gambler had some sort of complex and elaborate statical system then he could truly entertain that p, however if as described the gambler simply closes his eyes and picks the horse at random we cannot say that the gambler truly enterained that p. A second example is that of a man who's brain is operated on by a mad scientist and awakes asserting that "Goldbach's conjecture is true". No evidence  but mere disposition to assent stands in this case and it would seem that for the man to hold the belief that "Goldbach's conjecture is true" would be unjustified. This highlights an intregal component of Sartwell's stance on belief: no belief can stand in isolation. Sartwell holds that "I cannot have the belief that Goldbach's conjecture is true and fail to have any related beliefs" (158). From this Sartwell goes on to comment that in order to truly hold a belief, (1) absolutly must be fufilled. As Sartwell puts it "If the claim is withdrawn as soon as it is brought into question... we may rightly say it was not believed". Each belief for Sartwell must fit within a system of beliefs otherwise it is not correct to say that the belief was actually held. As such if a man trapped in a cave claims that it is raining out and when asked how he knows, he fails to provide any grounding or foundations for the belief but rather concedes that it was just a guess, then we cannot reliabilbly say that the man initllay did hold the belief in the first place. Sartwell's conjecture is simply that mere disposition to assent can often seem prima-facie as a belief.
      </p>

      <p>
        Sartwell proceeds in his argument by bringing knowledge into question from a linguist level as well. Sartwell asserts justification is mainly linguistically provided in cases when somebody poses the question in face of a portrayed beliefe: "How do you know?". In most when faced with the justification requestion, if no justification can be given it can't be said that the claimainst actually knew. However it is in intersting fact about such request in that request for justification only ever makes sense in cases in which there is un-certentity wheter the claim is in fact true. If a belief has already been proven true asking for justification is superfluous. Additionally, while even in cases where justifcation is inded superflous it seems the request for justification is still valid if the belief is not assume true by both parties. As such "how do you know?" can always be asked to ascertain of the rationale of the supposed knower. However, when asked the question "how do you know?" there is a point at which no more justification need be given in that "the demand for justification will eventually be rejected with regard to some proposition embedded in the justificaiton of the original claim". Sartwell uses the example of a child questioning the claim his parent provided that "elephants have trunks". The child's parent could justify this claim for quite a while when asked reptivivly "how do you know", by telling the child that he has seen pictures of elephants with trunks or have even seen actual elephants with trunks, and so on. However, at some point it seems the justification request must be denied. The point Sartwell wishes to make is that regardless of an epistemological analysis of knowledge, from a linguistic persepective knowledge is best construed as merely true belief. In light of this linguist analysis of knowledge, Sartwell provides several counter-examples to JTB+ as to show JTB+'s own deficienies.
      </p>

      <p>
        I won't go into detail on Sartwell's counter-examples to JTB+, however I will emphasize the relevant conclusion Sartwell reaches at the end of <i>Knolwedge is Merely True Belief</i> and what could be said to be Sartwell's purpose of the article. He comes to tie all theories of justification as serving the purpose being truth-conducive. In other words, Sartwell wants to offer a postive case that justificatoin is just insturmental to knowledge.  Citing authors who all seem to feel that TB could not be entertained, such as Bonjour, Alston, and Armstong, Sartwell argues in favor of TB in that our disagreement on the methods in which justifcation should be construed share a common view that the role of justification is that justification should approximate the truth. He even cites the foundationalist Bonjour as saying "It is only if we have some reason for thinking that epistemic justification constitues a path to the truth that we as congitive being have any motive for preffering justified beliefs to epistemically unjustified ones. Epistemic justificaiton is therefroe in the final analysis only an instrumental value, not an intrinstic one". 
      </p>

      <p>
        Adding to Sartwell's analysis of justification and knowledege from the linguist level Sartwell comments that when somebody asks the question "how do you know" of a claimaint, two distinct motives are conflated in such conjecture. The first motive for ask the claimant how they know something is that the inquierer is trying to assess whtether the claimnt does in fact know their belief or whether they merely hold their belief. Secondly, the questioner may be trying to assess the overall rationality of the claimianst and further assess their justification in thei belief. As such, for Sartwell, justification in linguistics again proves not to be a superflous abstraction or of no epistomological bearning but rather just an instrumental component of knowledge. Sartwell is in no way pushing in the direction of an epistemological anarchism by claiming that knowledge is true belief but rather just looking to question from a normative teleological conception, the way we thinka about knowledge. Accordingly, Sartwell's first paper can be seen not as concrete proof of epistemological minimalism, but rather just as a rehash and critical evaluation of the problem of the tie between justifciation and knowledge.

      <h2>II. Why is Knowledge Merely True Belief and Critisisms</h2>
      <p>
        Accordingly since in <i>Knowledge is Merely True Belief</i>, Sartwell offers no concrete argument or construction of a system in which knowledge could be viewed as merely true belief, I would now like to turn to Sartwell's <i>Why Knowledge is Merely True Belief</i> in which he does offer a proof constructing knowledge to be merely true belief.  As a foreword on Sartwell's argument, before presenting and and responding to counter-argumentation is that: Sartwell's goal for his epistomological account of knowledge is to be: normative and teleological. While the normative account he wishes to give will seek only to understand "How should we generate beliefs with regard to achieving knowledge? How should inquiry be conducted and evaluated? And what, exactly, is its goal, i.e., what is knowledge?", contrarily Sartwell does not wish to give a descriptive account of knowledege in describing the methods and procedures undergone in formation of belief and knowledge which can be seen more along the lines of congitive science than philosophy (168). Additionally, the teleological epistomological project he seeks should analyze the motive and ultimate ends of epistomology in contrast to methodological and deontological procedures for belief generation. Descriptive teleogloical, descriptive deontological, and normative deontological epistomological projects Sartwell notes are all interesting general epistomological projects however for an analysis of knowledge he does not want to breach into these teritories. That said, following is my reconstruction of Sartwell's argument:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Knowledge is the goal of inquiry (inquiry defined as: procedures that have their goal in generation of belief)</li>
        <li>Justification is defined as a correct procedure for inquiry</li>
        <li>[From 1-2] Justification is a means to true belief</li>
        <li>X being a means to goal Y does not make X a necessary component of Y</li>
        <li>Thus: Justification is only an instrumental component of knowledge</li>
      </ol>
      
      <p>
        (1) seems to be the most vulnerable premise as it seems to beg the question and Sartwell indeed concedes to this effect: "I have not gone very far to establish that point" (174). Though, Sartwell adds that, a theory of knowledge is bound to such inclination and he poses that if knowledge is not the goal of inquiry or the epistomological telos then why has so much "tremendous emphasis been place on the theory of knowledge in the history of philosophy". Further he inquires what better goal might be construed for a normative account of epistomology?
      </p>

      <p>
        Johathan Kvanig in an article entitled <i>The Value of Knowledge is External to it</i> indeeds attacks (1) arguing: "Is knowledge the goal of inquiry?... When we engage in inquiry we are trying to get to the truth about the subject matter in question. Inquiry ceases when we take ourselves to have found the truth". Kvanig adds that inquiry is intended to be truth-seeking rather than knowledge-seeking and to that extent that knowledge's purpose is meant to find truths and avoid errors. Kvanig goes on to attack (4), saying that while often (4) is granted, it is also sometimes the case that the means to something does in fact constitue a necessary a component of its goal. Kvanig cites the example: "If becoming elected a senator is the result of a sucessful campaign, then running a successful campaign can be both a means to this goal and a constituent as well" (42). Kvanig adds that while Sartwell wishes to claim that a means to a goal does not make said means necessary for a goal, in many cases soem means toward a goal are both necessary and sufficient for achieving that goal. Kvanig cites a second example that a means toward getting a million dollars is "getting a half a milllion, or getting nine hundred thousand, or getting the first dollar" in claiming "means can be necssary constituent of the goal in question".
      </p>
      <p>
        In response to Kvanig's attack of (1) I would like to re-emphasize Sartwell's position on the matter. (1) is in fact un-defended by Sartwell however it is a necessary component of his view. Any analysis of knowledge need make such inference. Kvanig emphasizes that inquiry seeks truth and ceases when the truth is found. Further that inquiry is such that "directed at finding the truth and "avoiding error"". The problem with Kvanig's point here is that he fails to grant any degree of charity to Sartwell's view. Criqutquing Sartwell's argument in saying that inquiry must find the truth and avoid error begs the question for JTB+ in the same way that TB begs the question in saying knowledge that the goal of inquiry. Neither is a completely logical claim and as Sartwell puts it "I would ask my accusers at this point whtether they can set out to analyze or describe without begging the question in favor of some such theory". Thus, begging the question is unavoidable in such discourse and Kvanig's line of begging the question is no better than Sartwell's. Outside of a study on linguistics I think this point need not be defended any further.
    </p>
    <p>
      One short note before commenting on Kvanig's critism of (4), Kvanig misinterprets from my reconstruction of Sartwell's argument (4) as: "Nothing that is merely a means to a goal is a necessary component of that goal" (42). This is not at all the stance Sartwell takes and I would refer the reader to the text in which Sartwell argues: "it is incoherent to build a specification of something regarded merely as a means of acheving some goal into the description of the goal itself". I surely am inclined to think that Sartwell was not attempting to assert earth-shattering ties between the connection of means and goals. As such, I do believe my (4) to be interpreatoin of Sartwell than Kvanig provides. Kvanig's position is obviously a strawman and as such it quickly dissolves in the face of counter-example. Kvanig asserts two counter-examples in which means to a certain goal are in fact a necessary component of the goal itself such to draw analogy to justification-knowledge connection. He never explicitly states that the connection between justification and knowledge is necessary but rather contends that such position is mistaken. For argument's sake if we grant that Kvanig was not pulling a strawman, his analogies in both examples fail to fit. As such the senator's who win's the race means and constituent to the goal to run a successful camapgin? What about if the senator rigs the election? Or how about if the senator simply kills all members of the opposing party in town? Even if we grant Kvanig's example it fails to prove his point. What about getting one, ten, or a half a million dollars in order to get a million dollars? Well I would simply not say that Kvanig here has provided a relevant example of the justifcation-knowledge relation. This is simply a poor analogy of a  goal with a singular means necessary as to reject the inference from (3-4) to (5) prima facie. In anycase, I do not believe Kvanig to have done his homework and properly given Sartwell any sufficient level of charity necessary to draw his inferences. Kvanig cited the article as being falacious from the point of view of somebody that had already made up their mind that TB could not be the case.

      <h3>III. On Gettier and the True Belief Analysis of Knowledge</h3>

      <p>As I touched on initially at the begining of this paper, construing knowledge as merely true belief can be seen as as an alternative in the oppositve direction to JTB+X analyses take to solving the Gettier problem.
        in light as the traditional ways those asserting knowledge to be at least justified true belief offer. The opponent of the true belief analysis of knowledge may claim that the Gettier case highlights the fundamental defficiency of TB. As such, since on TB, Gettier cases are considered knowledge it seems that intuitivly TB must be faulty. Sartwell would likely reply that this kind of view misses the point all together. If looked at from the stance of TB, justification is in fact present in Gettier cases, however it is apparent that 
      </p>

      <p>An intersting effect of constring knowledge to be merely true belief is that Gettier cases cease to be a relevant problem. The insufficiency of the JTB analysis of knowledge highlights why the Gettier case makes such a positive account for a true belief theory of knowledge. Epistomologists construing knowledge to be <i>at least justified true belief</i>do so by altering the sense in which a theory is said to be justified or a belief is such that it concedes to the truth. While in the Gettier case it is apparent that justifciation is present, in that Jones had good evidence, or justification, in forming the belief which happened to be true, it is incredibly diffucult to say why Jones does not have knowledge.
      </p>
      <p>
        An interesting consequence of asserting that knowledge is merely true belief as Sartwell does is that the Gettier problem seems to fade as a problem. However, it is not that Sartwell's analysis of knowledge solves the Gettier problem by way of adding additional criteria as proponents viewing that knowledge is atleast justified true belief does, but rather on the true belief analysis of knowledge Gettier cases are in fact cases of knowledge. So when Jones truely believe that the man who will get the Job has ten coins in his pocket then he actually does know this to be the case. Is this a problematic concern for Sartwell? No -- it is just telling about the extensivity of the true belief analysis of knowledge. Stephen Hetherington offers an interesting critque of the the true belief analysis of knowledge in which he mis-interprets the Gettier problem as being problematic for Sartwell. In a Gettier case, justification is present in any account and Sartwell would likely agre
      </p>

      <h3>IV. Criticisms of TB</h3>
      <p>
        There are far too many critisms of TB in the literature to survey each critism individually. As such, I will try to categorize critisims of TB into  several categories. It is seemingly diffucult to agree with the thesis which TB asserts when weighted against the historical analysis of knowledge as being JTB. However it is important to consider in these critisms.
      </p>

      <p>
        If true belief is the goal of inquiry, justification is only instrumental to inquiry.  The essential idea at play is that while justification is a sufficient criteria for knowledge it is not a necessary criteria. Knowledge is just true belief. This is not to say that justification is of no epistemological significance. Justification gives general procedures for inquiry to true belief and establishes standards for evaluating inquiry. However, justification is not intrinsic to knowledge but rather instrumental. I wish to explain Sartwell's goals in establishing a true belief analysis of knowledge and further support such analysis as superior to the JTB analysis of knowledge.
      </p>

      <p>
        A way of thinking about Sartwell's claim that knowledge merely true belief is to consider justification as happening at the level of belief rather than at the level of <i>knowledge</i>. As it so turns out justification is a necessary process at some point in fufilling the criteria of knowledge. For Gettier cases this introduce an interesting implication, mainly that for TB, simply a true belief is justified. If one were to accept

        * Motive to love of the truth -- inquiry?
        * Why is it not desirable to know certain things such as dinosaur ex...


        Another essential part of Sartwell's argument is that while he wishes show justification as instrumental to knowledge, he is by no means seeking out epistomological anarchy or asserting that justification has no purpose. In an article by Linda Zagzebski, Zagzebski proscribes an alternative approach to the analysis of knowledge in looking to differentiate what distinguishes true belief from knowledge. She uses the agent-actor model to show the way we must look at knowledge is having two properties: desirability and admirability. She feels that if a true belief is both admirable and desirable then the knowledge is more valuable than a true belief that is not admirable and not desirable. However, this analysis of the value of true beliefs has issues as well and as Zagzebksi puts it, it introduce a new style Gettier problem. It is such that if the true belief's admirability and desirability is not linked or due to some relevant factor there is a problem that is introduced. Zagzebski called this problem the new style Gettier problem. This is solved by the notions of admirable and desirability being linked together by some factor. An example of a belief that is admirable and desirable is that of the math teacher who has learned of the pythagroeon theorm through the extesnive study of mathematics. For the teacher that has learned so has a belief that is desirable and admirable in its acquistion.  However the notion of desirablity serves to eliminate Gettier cases from Zagzebski's analysis of value. The notion of desirability sets it so that only beliefs that are formed by good de-ontological action are desirable. So desirability impends on the prospect of a new style Gettier problem.
