      A first intuition or response to the conjecture that knowledge is merely true belief is most likely disgust. 


      --> A Gettier Style Introduction and the JTB + X Account

      What should our analysis of knowledge be? For a long while it was widely accepted that knowledge is justified true belief.  However, the problem for the JTB analysis of knowledge was infmaously made apaprent by Edumnund Gettier and the "Gettier" problem. The Gettier problem or Gettier cases often take the format of:

      The problem with the Gettier problem is that the JTB analysis of knowledge no longer seems a valid analysis because regardless of the matter that Jones knew that the man who would gtet the job has ten coins in his pocket -- he came to this knowledge by wha tseems to be the wrong means. It seems that intuitivly we would want to say in this case that Jones did not in facet know that p, but rather the JTB analysis of knowledge need come into question. But what then would another analysis of knolwedge look like? Many theories have been proposed along the lines of -- lets tack on an additional criteria to the JTB analysis of knowldge. The problem with the JTB + X analysis of knowledge is that adding the additional X criteria mainly serves to add a stricter binding on what it is to have belief.

      --> K=TB as an alternative to JTB+X

      Where X is should be a good reason that a belief is justified. The idea of adding an additional criteria to the JTB analysis of knowledge in order to avoid Gettier problems seems to tie somehow to the truth conduciveness of the belief.

      Crispin Sartwell provides an alternative analysis of knowledge in presenting that rahter tack on an additional cirteria to the JTB analysis of knowledge -- igt is a better notion to
