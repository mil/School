      <p>
        Traditional epistemological analyses of knowledge assert knowledge to be justified true belief.  However, such analysis are problematic. The classical Gettier case is: Suppose Jones forms the belief <i>p</i> that: the man who will get the job has 10 coins in his pocket. Jones holds <i>p</i> on the well-founded evidence that he knows: 1. Smith will get the job and 2. Smith has 10 coins in his pocket. Then, it turns out that Smith does not get the job, but rather Jones himself gets the job and has 10 coins. In this case, <i>p</i> still holds (and satifies JTB), however epistomologists often say it seems intuitively wrong to say that Jones knew that <i>p</i>. Gettier cases spawn a slew of theories tacking on an additional criteria for knowledge to JTB.  Another approach to the Gettier problem is to consider knowledge to be merely true belief as presented by Crispin Sartwell in <i>Knowledge is Merely True Belief</i> and <i>Why Knowledge is Merely True Belief</i>. This a minimimal analysis, considering mere true belief to constittue knowledge, avoids the Gettier problem all together. So if it turns out Jones gets the job, then Jones did actually know that <i>p</i>. Proceeding, I will firstly analyze the motivation and argument for Sartwell's minimal analysis of knowledge, secondly refute criticism directed at Sartwell's analysis of knowledge, and finally offer additional counter-argumentation which may arise in the face of a minimalist analysis of knowledge.

      <h2>I. Entertaining the Possibility that Knowledge is Merely True Belief</h2>
      <p>
        The purpose of Sartwell's first article, <i>Knowledge is Merely True Belief</i> is to offer an initial consturction of knowledge as mere true belief and justification being instrumental to knowledge. Sartwell does not offer "proof" that knowledge is merely true belief but rather offers a persuasive construction of knowledge such that this is the case.  Firstly, Sartwell provides counter-examples that will likely be argued from those denying that knowledge is mere true belief. He then uses these examples to show that when his opponents question the validity of <i>TB</i>, that intutitive counter-examples will not suffice as being even instances of belief. Defining what constitues belief is an essential component of dismissing potential counter-examples to TB. Sartwell defines belief according to R. B. Braithwaite's <i>The Nature of Believing</i>. In Braithwaite's account, for a subject S to hold the belief that p, the following two criteria must be met: 
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>S entertains p</li>
        <li>S has a disposition to act as if p were true</li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        Sartwell provides 4 counter-examples which could be provided by somebody denying TB but fail to satify these criteria of believe. Mainly the point Sartwell wishes to make with his counter-examples is that (2) is very commonplace to occur and appear prima facie as belief in the absence of (1). Proceeding, I will reconstruct two of Sartwell's counter-examples to TB and show how while they may suffice for (2) they will not suffice for (1). The first example I will provide is that of a gambler. A gambler closes his eyes, puts his finger on a horse on a racing form, and then conseqeuntly bets the baby on that horse. Surely in this case, the gambler may have a dispotion to assent that the horse will win the race and thus fufill requirement (2) for belief. However, how could the gambler be said to truly entertain the belief p: that the horse would win? Perhaps if the gambler had some sort of complex and rigorous statical system then he could truly entertain that p, however if as described the gambler simply closes his eyes and picks the horse at random we cannot say that the gambler enterained that p. A second example is that of a man who's brain is operated on by a mad scientist and awakes asserting that "Goldbach's conjecture is true". No evidence  but mere disposition to assent stands in this case and it would seem that for the man to hold the belief that "Goldbach's conjecture is true" would be unjustified. This highlights an intergal component of Sartwell's view of belief: no belief can stand in isolation. Sartwell holds that "I cannot have the belief that Goldbach's conjecture is true and fail to have any related beliefs" (158). From this Sartwell goes on to comment that in order to have a belief (1) is critical. As Sartwell puts it "If the claim is withdrawn as soon as it it brought into question... we may rightly say it was not believed". Each belief for Sartwell must fit within a system of beliefs otherwise it is not correct to say that the belief was actually held. As such if a man trapped in a cave claims that: "it is raining out" and when asked how he knows, he fails to provide any grounding or foundations for the belief then we cannot reliabilbly say that the man initllay did hold the belief in the first place.
      </p>

      <p>
        Sartwell proceeds by bringing knowledge into question from a linguist level. Sartwell asserts that when somebody asks the question of "How do you know?" that this is a request for justification. In most cases a justification can be provided in face of the question "how do you know?", however there is a point at which no more justification can be given in that "the demand for justification will eventually be rejected with regard to some proposition embedded in the justificaiton of the original claim". Sartwell uses the example of a child questioning the claim that "elephants have trunks". To this extent the child's parent could justify the claim by telling the child that he has seen pictures of elephants with trunks or have even seen actual elephants with trunks. However, the justification request can always be asked and at some point "the demand for justification will eventually be rejected with regard to some proposition embedded in the justificatoin of the original claim". The point Sartwell wishes to make is that regardless of an epistemological analysis of knowledge, from a linguistic persepective knowledge is best construed as merely true belief. In light of linguist analysis of knowledge Sartwell provides several counter-examples to typical analysis of knowledge as being justified true belief.

      <h2>II. A Proof of Knowledge as Merely True Belief</h2>
      <p>
        Although in <i>Knowledge is Merely True Belief</i> Sartwell offers a positive account of the rationale behind accepting knowledge to be mere true beleif he does not offer a concrete proof. Accordingly, I would now like to turn to Sartwell's <i>Why Knowledge is Merely True Belief</i> in which he does offer a proof construing knowledge to be merely true belief. Following is my reconstructio of Sartwell's argument that knowledge is mere true belief:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>An epistemic analysis of knowledge should be normative and teleological</li>
        <li>Epistemology's over-arching telos is truth</li>
        <li>Knowledge is the telos of inquiry (procuedres that have their goal in generaiton of belief)</li>
        <li>A belief is justified if it is produced by a correct proceudure for inquiry</li>
        <li>Thus: Justification is only an instrumental component of knowledge</li>
      </ol>


      <p>
        Before considering counter-argumentaiton, I wish to clarify Sartwell's premises such that his position is not misunderstood. Firstly an absolutly critical underpinning of Sartwell's argument is that the epistomlogical analysis of knowledge he wishes to construe is normative and teleological. Normative is meant in contrast to descriptive epistomology. While a descriptive epistomological project seeks to describe the methods and procedures we undergo in formation of belief and knowledge (cognitive science), normative epistomology alternative seeks to only understand "How should we generate beliefs with regard to achieving knowledge? How should inquiry be conducted and evaluated? And what, exactly, it its goal, i.e., what is knowledge?" (168). Additionally, an teleological epistomological project seeks to understand the motive and ultimate ends of epistomological in contrast to methodological and deontoligcal procedures for belief generation. Descriptive teleogloical, descriptive deontological, and normative deontological epistomological projects are all valid projects and

      <p>
        If true belief is the goal of inquiry, justification is only instrumental to inquiry.  The essential idea at play is that while justification is a sufficient criteria for knowledge it is not a necessary criteria. Knowledge is just true belief. This is not to say that justification is of no epistemological significance. Justification gives general procedures for inquiry to true belief and establishes standards for evaluating inquiry. However, justification is not intrinsic to knowledge but rather instrumental. I wish to explain Sartwell's goals in establishing a true belief analysis of knowledge and further support such analysis as superior to the JTB analysis of knowledge.
      </p>

      <p>
        A way of thinking about Sartwell's claim that knowledge merely true belief is to consider justification as happening at the level of belief rather than at the level of <i>knowledge</i>. As it so turns out justification is a necessary process at some point in fufilling the criteria of knowledge. For Gettier cases this introduce an interesting implication, mainly that for TB, simply a true belief is justified. If one were to accept

      --> Lycan's Criticism of K = TB
      Lycan provides critisism to the Sartwell's minimal account of knowledge by drawing

      --> Kvanig's Critism of K = TB
      Johnathan Kvanig in an article entitled <i>The Value of knowledge is external to it</i> contemplates Sartwell's K=TB thesis, however dismisses it as a falacious argument by insisting that justification is more than instrumental to knowledge. Kvanig questions Sartwell's premise that: "knowledge is the goal of inquiry" in contorting that "inquiry is not direct at knowledge in either of these sesnes by its very nature, but instaed can be, and often is (perhaps usually is), "directed at" finding the fruth and avoiding error". The problem with Kvanig's critism of minimalism it that Kvanig deeply misunderstands Sartwell's position. Very simply I  accuse Kvanig of pulling a strawman on Sartwell in this regard.  In fact, Sartwell would likely respond to Kvanig's counter-argumentation by agreeing with most of it and simply specifying what minimalism is. When Kvanig claism that: "Inquiry....often is.. "directed at" finding the truth and avoiding error" over knowledge being the telos of inquiry -- Sartwell would likely reply in this vein. For Sartwell "finding truth and avoiding error" is equivocally the same as "knowledge". The only part of Kvanig's consruction of the telos of inquiry which Sartwell would likely hope to specify is that "avoiding error" is likely implied. When one embarks on the quest of inquiry it is implied that error should be avoided. However, the overarching telos of inquiry is <i>not</i> to avoid errors but rather to seek truths. In this construal of the telos of inquiry the minimal hypothesis can still apply. Avoiding errors is simply a means to get to the truth. If it just so happened we lived in a world where every time we asserted a guess it turned out to be a true guess then our sense of inquiry would need no avoidance of errors. In fact for some individuals such as the telepathic or the whateverthefuckthatguyiscalled this is their sense of inquiry

      Avoiding error will always be a component of seeking truths however avoiding errors should not be seen as an interegral means to the telos of the goal of inquiry.  Kvanig wants to claim that justification is not of merely instrumental value to knowledge and that the justification is a necssary compontent of knolwedge. While Sartwell argues that justification in addition to a true belief is knowledge however justification is not a necssary component, Kvanig argues that justification is a necessary compontent. Kvanig's objection is that: justification is a means toward knowledge and justification is also a necssary compontent of knowledge. He provides the example of a canidate running for senator: "If becoming a senator is the reuslt of a sucessful comapain, then running a sucessful campaign can be both a means to this goal and a constituent as well".  Kvanig admits that "most means to a goal are not sufficient for the achievement of the goal to which they are directed", he denies that such a case applies in the justification-knowledge relation. The problem with Kvanig's argument is that he provides no proper explanation for <i>why</i> justification must be a necessary compontent for knowledge. On the other side Sartwell is able to provide explanation whyu a minimal construal of knowledge can apply. Kvanig provides two analogies to the justificatoin-knowledge relation of how means can also be necessary compontents - however both of these examples are incapable of withstanding counterexample. Consider Kvanig's anlogy to the justificaiton-knowledge relation of a candiate who's means to getting elected as senator is running a successful campaign. While, running a successful campaign may be sufficient in addition to getting the required votes to get elected, the absecnce of running a sucessful campaign in combination with rigging the election or killing all the mebers of the opposing party would also suffice for getting the candiate elected. Kvanig wishes to imply that justification is a necessary compontent of knowledge however he provides no reason behind why that is the case.

      --> Zagzebski and the Agent->Actor Model
      * Admirable -- crossing over into telos?
      * Motive to love of the truth -- inquiry?
      * Why is it not desirable to know certain things such as dinosaur ex...

      Zagzebski perscripes an alternative approach to the analysis of knowledge and looking to differentiate what is the signifigant difference between true belief and knowledge. She uses the agent actor model in showing that the way we must look at knowledge is having two properties: desirability and admirability. She feels that if a true belief is both admirable and desirable then the knowledge is more valuable than a true belief that is not admirable and not desirable. However, this analysis of value of true beliefs has issues as well and as Zagzebksi puts it, it introduce a new style Gettier problem. It is such that if the true belief's admirability and desirability is not linked or due to some relevant factor there is a problem that is introduced. Zagzebski called this problem the new style Gettier problem. This is solved by the notions of admirable and desirability being linked together by some factor. An example of a belief that is admirable and desirable is that of the math teacher who has learned of the pythagroeon theorm through the extesnive study of mathematics. For the teacher that has learned so has a belief that is desirable and admirable in its acquistion.  However the notion of desirablity serves to eliminate Gettier cases from Zagzebski's analysis of value. The notion of desirability sets it so that only beliefs that are formed by good de-ontological action are desirable. So desirability impends on the prospect of a new style Gettier problem.
