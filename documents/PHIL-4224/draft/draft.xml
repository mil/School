      A first intuition or response to the conjecture that knowledge is merely true belief is most likely disgust. 


      --> A Gettier Style Introduction and the JTB + X Account

      What should our analysis of knowledge be? For a long while it was widely accepted that knowledge is justified true belief.  However, the problem for the JTB analysis of knowledge was infmaously made apaprent by Edumnund Gettier and the "Gettier" problem. The Gettier problem or Gettier cases often take the format of:

      The problem with the Gettier problem is that the JTB analysis of knowledge no longer seems a valid analysis because regardless of the matter that Jones knew that the man who would gtet the job has ten coins in his pocket -- he came to this knowledge by wha tseems to be the wrong means. It seems that intuitivly we would want to say in this case that Jones did not in facet know that p, but rather the JTB analysis of knowledge need come into question. But what then would another analysis of knolwedge look like? Many theories have been proposed along the lines of -- lets tack on an additional criteria to the JTB analysis of knowldge. The problem with the JTB + X analysis of knowledge is that adding the additional X criteria mainly serves to add a stricter binding on what it is to have belief.

      --> K=TB as an alternative to JTB+X

      Where X is should be a good reason that a belief is justified. The idea of adding an additional criteria to the JTB analysis of knowledge in order to avoid Gettier problems seems to tie somehow to the truth conduciveness of the belief.

      Crispin Sartwell provides an alternative analysis of knowledge in presenting that rahter tack on an additional cirteria to the JTB analysis of knowledge -- igt is a better notion to. 

      Sartwell provides insight into the JTB analysis of knowledge by considering what purpose justification serves. The root of Sartwell's argument lies in his deduction that existing theories of justification and analyses of knowledge almost exclusivly construe the purpose of justification to link the belief to the truth. 


      --> Lycan's Criticism of K = TB

      Lycan provides critisism to the Sartwell's minimal account of knowledge by drawing

      --> Kvanig's Critism of K = TB

      Johnathan Kvanig in an article entitled <i>The Value of knowledge is external to it</i> contemplates Sartwell's K=TB thesis however dismisses itas a falacious argument. Kvanig insists that justification is not instrumental as Sartwell holds but rather that justification is an intergral component of knowledge. Kvanig questions Sartwell's premise that: "knowledge is the goal of inquiry" in contorting that "inquiry is not direct at knowledge in either of these sesnes by its very nature, but instaed can be, and often is (perhaps usually is), "directed at" finding the fruth and avoiding error". The problem with Kvanig's critism of minimalism it that Kvanig deeply misunderstands Sartwell's position. Very simply I  accuse Kvanig of pulling a strawman on Sartwell in this regard.  In fact, Sartwell would likely respond to Kvanig's counter-argumentation by agreeing with most of it and simply specifying what minimalism is. When Kvanig claism that: "Inquiry....often is.. "directed at" finding the truth and avoiding error" over knowledge being the telos of inquiry -- Sartwell would likely reply in this vein. For Sartwell "finding truth and avoiding error" is equivocally the same as "knowledge". The only part of Kvanig's consruction of the telos of inquiry which Sartwell would likely hope to specify is that "avoiding error" is likely implied. When one embarks on the quest of inquiry it is implied that error should be avoided. However, the overarching telos of inquiry is <i>not</i> to avoid errors but rather to seek truths. In this construal of the telos of inquiry the minimal hypothesis can still apply. Avoiding errors is simply a means to get to the truth. If it just so happened we lived in a world where every time we asserted a guess it turned out to be a true guess then our sense of inquiry would need no avoidance of errors. In fact for some individuals such as the telepathic or the whateverthefuckthatguyiscalled this is their sense of inquiry

      Avoiding error will always be a component of seeking truths however avoiding errors should not be seen as an interegral means to the telos of the goal of inquiry.  Kvanig wants to claim that justification is not of merely instrumental value to knowledge and that the justification is a necssary compontent of knolwedge. While Sartwell argues that justification in addition to a true belief is knowledge however justification is not a necssary component, Kvanig argues that justification is a necessary compontent. Kvanig's objection is that: justification is a means toward knowledge and justification is also a necssary compontent of knowledge. He provides the example of a canidate running for senator: "If becoming a senator is the reuslt of a sucessful comapain, then running a sucessful campaign can be both a means to this goal and a constituent as well".  Kvanig admits that "most means to a goal are not sufficient for the achievement of the goal to which they are directed", he denies that such a case applies in the justification-knowledge relation. The problem with Kvanig's argument is that he provides no proper explanation for <i>why</i> justification must be a necessary compontent for knowledge. On the other side Sartwell is able to provide explanation whyu a minimal construal of knowledge can apply. Kvanig provides two analogies to the justificatoin-knowledge relation of how means can also be necessary compontents - however both of these examples are incapable of withstanding counterexample. Consider Kvanig's anlogy to the justificaiton-knowledge relation of a candiate who's means to getting elected as senator is running a successful campaign. While, running a successful campaign may be sufficient in addition to getting the required votes to get elected, the absecnce of running a sucessful campaign in combination with rigging the election or killing all the mebers of the opposing party would also suffice for getting the candiate elected. Kvanig wishes to imply that justification is a necessary compontent of knowledge however he provides no reason behind why that is the case.

      --> Zagzebski and the Agent->Actor Model
      * Admirable -- crossing over into telos?
      * Motive to love of the truth -- inquiry?
      * Why is it not desirable to know certain things such as dinosaur ex...

      Zagzebski perscripes an alternative approach to the analysis of knowledge and looking to differentiate what is the signifigant difference between true belief and knowledge. She uses the agent actor model in showing that the way we must look at knowledge is having two properties: desirability and admirability. She feels that if a true belief is both admirable and desirable then the knowledge is more valuable than a true belief that is not admirable and not desirable. However, this analysis of value of true beliefs has issues as well and as Zagzebksi puts it, it introduce a new style Gettier problem. It is such that if the true belief's admirability and desirability is not linked or due to some relevant factor there is a problem that is introduced. Zagzebski called this problem the new style Gettier problem. This is solved by the notions of admirable and desirability being linked together by some factor. An example of a belief that is admirable and desirable is that of the math teacher who has learned of the pythagroeon theorm through the extesnive study of mathematics. For the teacher that has learned so has a belief that is desirable and admirable in its acquistion.  However the notion of desirablity serves to eliminate Gettier cases from Zagzebski's analysis of value. The notion of desirability sets it so that only beliefs that are formed by good de-ontological action are desirable. So desirability impends on the prospect of a new style Gettier problem.
