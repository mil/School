        This study investigated reinforcement of signaling from a behavioral prospective in 4 different 6 to 10 month old infants. The procedure for sign-training was similar to a prior study, Thompson et al. (2004), however in addition to physical prompting, model prompting was used in reinforcing signaling behavior of infants. During each sign training trial, a model prompt was presented to the infant. If the infant didn't respond to the model within a certain number of seconds, then the infant was physically prompted. The first experiment in this study evaluated the effects of delayed model and physical prompts in 2 infants, finding that under a number of stimulus conditions, the infants signing could be seen learned through reinforcement.  Experiment 2 built ontop of the model and physical sign prompting procedure and combined said procedure with the extinction of crying and whining behaviors. Resultingly it was shown that when the infants began to independently sign there was a dramatic decline in the duration and intensity of crying and whining. These results suggest that it is beneficial for young children to learn signs prior to spoken language. Using model and physical prompting infants can manifest effective expressive language earlier than spoken language. Addtionally, young children at risk of developmental or language delays may benefit from signing. Being able to evaluate infants language abilities at such an early ages opens up new possibilities for developmental studies to analyze infants' language at stages of development.
