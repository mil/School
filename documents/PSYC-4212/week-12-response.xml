        This study investigated category learning prototype-extraction in context of discerning between explicit and implicit memory. Prior research suggest that there exists an implicit memory system, independent of explicit memory. However, the validity of prior research is unclear because it is possible that in the test phase (assessing categorization) that only a small number of features may have been used to distinguish the prototype from the study phase. In this study, elderly, memory-impaired patients, Alzheimer's patients, amnesiacs, and undergraduates were included as test subjects. The experimental design of the first experiment was conducted similar to Reed et al. (1999) in its study phase. However, unlike Reed et al. (1999), during the test phase subjects were presented with a pair of test items and asked to judge which member was a better example of the category presented during training versus a simple yes-or-no test. The stimuli used in the study and testing phases of Experiment 1 were cartoon-animals presented on a standard computer screen. During the study phase, one of the animals was selected as a prototype displayed to the subject. In Experiment 2, instead of testing categorization of cartoon-animals, Squire's (1993) dot-pattern paradigm was employed for the training and testing of subsequent categorization. ANOVAs were used in the analysis of the resulting categorization by the subjects for both experiments. Results indicated that subjects made use of a small number of features of the prototype learning in the study phase. Further, this evidence suggests that even subjects with a single memory system can utilize several features of the prototype for categorization. These results bring into question the existence of a distinct implicit memory system.
