        This study assessed beer recognition of "beer experts" in comparison with novices. Subjects were tested on three different tasks. The first task was an identification task in which subjects tasted a number of beers and were asked to match the beers given a set of written descriptions of each beer. The second task was the recognition task which was divided up into two phases: learning and recognition. During the learning phase, participants were asked to either taste beers or smell odors of beers and memorize them. Then, in the recognition phase, subjects tasted a new unknown set of beers and were asked about their confidence level of if they had previously tasted each beer. The third and final task subjects were tested on was the discrimination task. In this task, each subject was given 14 pairs of beers and for each pair, the subject was asked to identify if the beers were identical or different. T-tests and ANOVAs were run on the results from each tasks to compare the novices to the "beer experts" in performance. It was found that "beer experts" did indeed outperform novices in the identification and recognition memory tasks. However, it was found that "beer experts" failed to yield statistically significant results in the discrimination task. This study's results converge with a previous study by Parr et al. (2002) that showed that wine experts outperform novices in odor recognition tasks. Regardless, this study found no statistically significant correlation between odor and beer memory performance. This indicates that experts superiority in recognition is not a perceptual advantage but rather more related to efficient coding and retrieval from long-term memory.
