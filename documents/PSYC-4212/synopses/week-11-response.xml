        This study investigated reinforcement of signaling from a behavioral prospective in several 6 to 10 month old infants. The procedure for sign-training was similar to a prior study done by Thompson et al. (2004), however, unlike their procedure, model prompting was used in reinforcing signaling behavior of infants in addition to physical prompting of Thompson et al. (2004). During each sign training trial a model prompt was presented to the infant. If the infant did not respond to the model within a certain number of seconds, then the infant was physically prompted to perform the sign in an accurate way. The first experiment in this study evaluated the effects of delayed model and physical prompts in 2 infants, finding that under a number of stimulus conditions, the infants signing could be seen learned through reinforcement.  Experiment 2 combined the sign prompting procedure with extinction of crying and whining behaviors. Resulting, it was shown that when the infants began to independently sign there was a dramatic decline in the duration and intensity of crying and whining. These results suggest that it is beneficial for young children to learn signs prior to spoken language. Using model and physical prompting infants have the ability to manifest effective expressive language earlier than spoken language. Additionally, young children at risk of developmental or language delays may benefit from signing. Being able to evaluate infants language abilities at such an early ages opens up new possibilities for developmental studies to analyze infants' language at early stages of development.
