      <p>
        The question I wish to address is generally: how are hierarchies utilized in cognitive task-based processes? Additionally, this entails addressing what role hierachies serve in such cognitive processes. The simple answer, prima facie, to this question is that hierarchies provide structure in the resolution of the dependenceies of cognitive tasks. As such, if your ultimate goal is to bake a cake, there are several tasks and numerous nested-sub-tasks that must be achieved inorder to adhere to the ultimate goal (before you put the tray in the oven, you must first construct the batter, and the batter itself has its own related sub-tasks). While, hierarchies can be seen as a useful cognitive structure for the funcitonal decomposition of tasks ahdering to a clear goal, hierarchies additionally can be seen as a cognitive tool organzing tasks to make realization toward an end goal. For an example in this line, the man who engages in tasks and sub-tasks related to styding psychology and related acedemic discplines every day may not intend to go to graduate school however the constructive nature of such tasks form a hierarchial structure faciliating this goal. As such, there is a interconnected bi-directional relation between the tasks of a hierarchy's end goals and the tasks themselves. Addressing this discordance between hierarchies instantiated from the resolution of dependicies of tasks and the constructive nature of tasks in forming hierarchial structures is under-addressed in the literature. Basically, my view on this matter is that if any set cognitive tasks can be seen either implicitly or explicitly as conducing towards a goal, then a hierarchial model may be used to understand the composition and relation of the involved tasks.

        This article surveys existing literatere to understand model-based approaches to cognitive task processes. It's authors do so by considered three distinictive models utilzied in analyzing cognitive tasks: the Abstraction Hierarchy (AH), Multilevel Flow Modeling (MF), and Decision Ladder Modeling (DL). Work domain structure models (WDS) and Work Domain Goal models (WDG) are distinguished as being two types of approaches which the three models at hand can be classified in the contenxt of. WDS models describe the structure of the system being controlled. WDS models exist independent of worker, automation, task, or interface. WDS purely describes abstraction and not iimplementation. Contrarilty, WDG models describes the goals of components of a system such as the desired states. Additionally one more abstraction must be provided to understand the three models at hand. Action-means-end (AME) is to be in contrast to stuctural-means-end (SME). Where AME describes actions which conduce means to an end goal in a WDG framwork, SME simply  describes the structural relation between the means and the end goal.

        This article provides an indepth anlysis of the framework which is adhered to in following written directions. I this study subjects were gives a set of written directions

      </p>
      <p>
        A set of written directions can be seen as being functionally equivilant to a set of cognitive tasks. Additionally in both instances, in that of directions or mental tasks, they may or may not adhere to a particular goal. This study positivly re-inforced the notion that in explicit directions which are subsequently seen as cognitive tasks, that if such tasks are viewed as goal-oriented then a hierachy can be observed.
