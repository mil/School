      <p>
        The question I wish to address is generally: how are hierarchies utilized in cognitive tasks? Very generally, the line of inquiry which I am concerned is: what is the role of hierarchies in cognition? This additionally entails addressing how we construct hierarchies in memory (bottom-up / top-down). In answering what role hierarchies serve in cognition, a study of the literature reveals that organizing tasks into mental hierarchierces provides structure for enabling meaningful relationships between various sets of tasks and sub-tasks . As such, if your ultimate goal is to bake a cake, there are several tasks and numerous nested sub-tasks that must be achieved in order to achieve to the ultimate goal of getting the baked cake (first must make the batter, then put the batter in a tray, then in the oven, and so on in a sequential ordering of tasks). While, this top-down decomposition of cognitive tasks seems omnipresent when retrospecitvly anlyzing tasks, when addressing each specific task or sub-task, the hierarchy can be seen as being utilzed bottom-up. As such, there are multiple ways to prepare the battter, multiple trays to put the batter in, and numerous ways to make the batter rise. As such, in the analysis of congitive tasks, the top-down/bottom-up distinction is not so clear cut.  Hence, there is a interconnected bi-directional relation between the tasks of a hierarchy's end goals and the tasks themselves. Addressing this discordance between hierarchies instantiated top-down versus bottom-up in relation to memory is severly lacking in the literature. The view I wish to develop through this survey of the literature is that task hierarchies need a more complex abstraction of memory in order fully understood.

        This study illustrates how the phrasing of written directions leads to a hierarchial representation of cognitive tasks. In this study, subjects were provided sentences in which depenent information needed to complete a cognitive task was embeded in each sentence along with the overall goal of the task. One such example of a sentence used was: "Press button A to turn light Y on". In this example, in order to understand and cognitivly process the direction "turn light Y on", the dependency embeded in the sentence of "Press button A" needed to be processed first. Thus, a hierarchy of tasks in each trial was induced in either a top-down or bottom-up fashion depending on the placement of the dependent action. In initial experimention, this study found that when the goal came before the dependent action, such as: "light Y should be on after pressing button A", execution time was both slower and less accurate than when the dependent information proceeded the goal outright. However, a subsequent experiment proved that while execution was slower and less accurate when viewed top-down, when recall instaed of execution was requested of the subjects, the top-down presentation seemed more efficient. This suggests that hierarchies of tasks are stored in memory top-down regardless or how the hierarchy of tasks is initially presented. However, the question still is, it is necessary for hierarchy to be invoked in simple tasks with a one step dependence.. as is the case with: "light Y should be on after pressing button A". In these cases, if the task is viewed in abscence of a hierarchy, normal sequential presentation yields quicker results than result sequential presentation of the task.
      </p>
      <p>
        These results positivly adress my research question by showing that when actions are translated into written language that hierarchies can be seen in the nature of cognitive task-dependence. It seems that if the tasks are simple and do not need be stored past short-term memory, then it seems hierarchies are merely a contigent component of cognitive task modeling. However, once recall of the task is invoked and working-memory in some way processes the tasks in cognitive, a hiererchial representation of the tasks is invoked. As such, in this study it was observed that recall was more efficient when presented in a top-down hierarchial fashion as the processing needed for recall was presented initially. As such, when pressenting the phrase "light Y shoul dbe on after pressing button A", less further cognition and processeing was required to store this simple hierarchy of tasks in working memory. This offers strong evidence of the presence and natural invokation of hierachial structures in storing tasks in working memory.

        This study proposes that information is progressivly encoded in hierarchial structures in long-term memory. To test this hypothesis, 18 subjects were given free-recall and problem-solving tasks. In the free-recall tasks, each subject was shown 16 objects and later asked to recall the objects. Some examples of the objects used were: jar, eraser, and rubber-band. A 4-level hierarchy was devised as the base model in which these objects were theorized to be categorized hierarchially. The study-test method (Kintsch, 1970) was used for testing responses. In free-recall, it was found that all subjects imposed some organizational hierarchy of the objects to varying degrees on multiple levels of abstarction. Although the levels on which subjects categorized the objects varied (some prioritizing shape, location, or color), there was statistically signifigant hierarhial structure visible in the recall of the objects for each subject. Further, in the problem-solving trials, Kintsch's study-test method was modified such that the subjects were asked about the charactisticits of each object in the form of successive yes-or-no question.  Similar to the free-recall trials results, the hierarchial nature of the objects faciliated quicker categorization and identification of each object. In each instance in the problem-solving tasks, categories were searched in hierarchial fashion from superoderinate to subordinate levels suggesting a top-down recognition of the hierachial nature of the object from the start.
      </p>
      <p>
        The results of this experiment clearly demonstrate the use of hierarchial organization in free-recall and problem-solving cognitive tasks. The question we are left with to this affective is why is relation between objects and a hierachy of models invoked in cognitive tasks. One possible explanation the author gives is that hierarhicla organizattoin may represent the mechanic nature of long-term memory stores and assimilation of information. As such, with any new piece of information we obtain we wish to determine how it related with our previous knowledge. Drawing connections and integreating new information into existing schemas within a hierachial fashion provides a way for us to convert seemingly irrelevant information to relevant information faciliated by pre-existing memory.

        This study found that there is a hierachy present in the construction of ensemble statistics in visual working memory. Subjects were presented with a number of circles of various colors on a screen. For each subject, there were multiple trials in which the circles appeared in different positions and sizes on the screen. Subjects after seeing a number of trials were prompted to provide the mean size of each circle. In the first experiment, only two colors (red and blue) were tested and subjects were told to ignore green circles and only remeber the size of red and blue circles. In the second experiment, the green circles were removed all together and subjects were told simply to remember the overall size of the circles. In the first experiment, during the test phase it was shown that the subjects exhibited a bias to the ensemble statistic size depending on the color circle versus the overall mean circle size. In the second experiment, although only the mean size was requested of the subjects, when later asked to size the red and blue circles independnetly, the subjects did so accuratly regardless of the mean size. Additionally, in the second expriment the subjects were asked to size a black circle so that it could be tested if an ensemble statistic was stored in visual working memory of the circles mean size independnet of color as well. Statistically signifigant results indicated that in addition to being able to categorize the circles' sizes based on color, subjects could categorize the circles overall mean size when presented with the black circle.
      </p>
      <p>
        These results greatly support my research question in showing that if we assume a prototypal nature of visual working memory, there can be noted hierachy at multiple levels of the protoypes. Information within visual working memory, as with linguistic memory as seen with my first article, and long-term memory with my second article, is naturally hierarchially categorized. This study suggest that working memory is suspectible to dependence between items and hierarchial organization in the same way that long-term memory is constructive and hierarchial. This implies that working-memory is constructive in a bottom-up fashion in acquistion and deconstructive in a top-down fashion in regards to ensembles statiscs in recall.

      </div>
      <p>
        This study analyzed the nature of hierachial coding both from a pereceptual view and from a memory level in regards to spatial layouts. Participants were presented with a a spatial layout of houses labeled A-R in arbitrary positions and in three differntent conditions asked to estimate the distance between the houses presented. The first session was the perecpetual session in which the subject viewed the map while estimating the distances. The second session was the memory condtion in which the subject had to memory the houses and then answer the questions without the map. THe third session was a repeat of the first session. It was found that subjects just as readily showed hiererchial bias based on matched color of any given two houses both in the pereceptual and memory sessions. The author claims that this implies that we should view the hierachial structure as an aspect of perception instead of an aspect of memory. Before an object can pass to working-memory, it must first pass perception and the results of this study question whether it is working-memory infact imposing the hierachial and associative nature of items or simply perception.
      </p>
      <p>
        These results conflict with all the other introduced articles to date in saying that the hierarchial nature of cognition is not in relation to memory but rather perception. These results seem weekly unfounded however. I think from the current study we cannot gauage in which step the hierrchial organization of the houses took place because to even recite back and be tested on the distance between the houses would imply even in the perception condition that the houses entered working memory. If the author truly wanted to test wheter the original perception or memory was the factor responsible for introduction of hierchial structure in cognition, the best test would likely be to test more than visual stimuli to eliminate the numerous unaccounted cofound in this present study. Thus, on this present study I must reject the provided diverging evidence.

        This study compared both the efficient and preference of users in a selection task using a grid metaphor or a hierarchial metaphor. Subjects were presented a selection in one instance in which targets were organized in a two-level hierarchial fasion and in another trial as a 5x5 grid. Selection for both the hierachy and the grid took place on a small screen. In the both trials, subjects were requested to select the target based on a clue matching only one item in a pool of 25 items. One such clue might be: "makes holes". Some of the possible 25 targets included: chisel, hammer, sander, basebll, golf, or drill. In the hierachial organization, chisel, hammer, and sander would be categorized under tools, while baseball and golf would be categorized under sports. There were a total of 5 categories each with 5 nested items. It was found that users performed slower when presented with the 25 items organized in heirarchial fashion, however regardless subjects indicated that they had a preference for the hierachial organization in selection over viewing all 25 items at once.
 </p>
      <p>
        This study questions the need for hierarchies in option selection tasks all together. While for some complex tasks hierarchies are a necessary construct as they are the result of top-down analysis of each sub-task, this is not always the case. For simple option selection, categorization within hierarchial structures provides simple organization. While performance in such examples actually suffered, subjects maintained a preference for hierarhcially organized item selection over being presented with all 25 items at once. This brings into question the need for hierarchy. It may be that in simple selection tasks, hierarchies are simply an un-necessary construct, however it seems regardless that our cognition wishes to categorize information hierarchially regarldess. Additionally, this study adds that the preference for this cognition can be seen in behavior additionally despite performance loss. We seek organization, hirarchially, in any instance in which working-memory is involved as it is in our nature to organize taking prerence over emperical accounts of performance.
