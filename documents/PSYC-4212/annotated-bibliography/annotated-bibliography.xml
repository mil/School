        Pronounced hierarchies can clearly be observed in cognitive tasks and memory. Generally, hierarchies provide a way for our us to cognitively link models of otherwise seemingly disassociated information in memory. Addressing the presence of hierarchies in memory brings into question: whether the construction of hierarchies in memory is bottom-up or top-down in nature, the extent to which hierarchies can be observed through levels of abstractions in memory, and additionally, the overarching purpose or role of hierarchies presence in memory and cognition? A survey of the existing literature will reveal that hierarchies can be seen largely as bottom-up in the cognition of stimuli and top-down in the recall of information from memory. Additionally, it should be noted that starting at working memory and progressing even into long-term memory, our cognition stores information hierarchically even when no definite hierarchy can be observed in the origin stimuli. While it seems that hierarchies are clearly present in cognition and memory, the question we are left asking is: why this is the case? In short, the hierarchical modeling nature of our cognition and memory provides a way to associate information for higher-level analysis. This constructive nature may be viewed as bottom-up, but earnestly it reaches further than the top-down/bottom-up abstraction. When given any new piece of information it is in our cognitive nature to analyze that piece of information and determine how we can hierarchically integrate it with existing knowledge.

        This study illustrates how the phrasing of written directions leads to a hierarchical representation of cognitive tasks. In this study, subjects were provided sentences in which dependent information needed to complete a cognitive task was embedded in each sentence along with the overall goal of the task. One such example of a sentence used was: "Press button A to turn light Y on". In this example, in order to understand and cognitively process the direction "turn light Y on", the dependency embedded in the sentence of "Press button A" needed to be first processed. Thus, a hierarchy of tasks in each trial was induced in either a top-down or bottom-up fashion depending on the placement of the dependent action. In initial experimentation, this study found that when the goal came before the dependent action, such as: "light Y should be on after pressing button A", execution time was both slower and less accurate than when the dependent information proceeded the goal outright. However, a subsequent experiment proved that while execution was slower and less accurate when tested top-down, recall was faster when the sentence was initially presented as top-down. This suggests that hierarchies of tasks are stored in memory top-down regardless of how the hierarchy of tasks is initially presented. However, the question remains: is it necessary for hierarchy to be invoked at all in simple tasks with a one step dependence? Especially considering that in simple cases, if the task is viewed in absence of a hierarchy, normal sequential presentation yields quicker results than reverse sequential presentation of the task (invoking hierarchy).
      </p>
      <p>
        These results positively address my research question by showing that when actions are translated into written language that hierarchies can be seen in the nature of cognitive task-dependence. It seems that if the tasks are simple and do not need be stored past short-term memory, then it seems hierarchies are merely a contingent component of cognitive task modeling. However, once recall of a task is invoked and working-memory in some way processes the tasks in cognition, a hierarchical representation of the tasks is involved. As such, in this study it was observed that recall was more efficient when presented in a top-down hierarchical fashion. As such, when presenting the phrase "light Y should be on after pressing button A", less further cognition and processing was required to store this simple hierarchy of tasks in working memory. This offers strong evidence of the presence and natural invocation of hierarchical structures in storing tasks in working memory.

        This study proposes that information is progressively encoded in hierarchical structures in long-term memory. To test this hypothesis, 18 subjects were given free-recall and problem-solving tasks. In the free-recall tasks, each subject was shown 16 objects and later asked to recall the objects. Some examples of the objects used were: jar, eraser, and rubber-band. A 4-level hierarchy was devised as the base model in which these objects were theorized to be categorized hierarchically. The study-test method (Kintsch, 1970) was used for testing responses. In free-recall, it was found that all subjects imposed some organizational hierarchy on the objects to varying degrees on multiple levels of abstraction. Although the levels on which subjects categorized the objects varied (some prioritizing shape, location, or color), there was statistically significant hierarchal structure visible in the recall of the objects for each subject. Further, in the problem-solving trials, Kintsch's study-test method was modified such that the subjects were asked about the characteristics of each object in the form of successive yes-or-no question.  Similar to the free-recall trials results, the hierarchical nature of the objects facilitated quicker categorization and identification of each object. In each instance in the problem-solving tasks, categories were searched in hierarchical fashion from superordinate to subordinate levels suggesting a top-down recognition of the hierarchal nature of the object.
      </p>
      <p>
        The results of this experiment clearly demonstrate the use of the hierarchical organization in free-recall and problem-solving cognitive tasks. This study converges with the results of the first study in that it seems that there is in integral ties between information stored in memory and the invocation of hierarchy in categorization.  Further, the results of this study imply that hierarchal structure in memory goes even further than working memory in bridging into long-term memory.

        This study found that there is a hierarchy present in the construction of ensemble statistics in visual working memory. Subjects were presented with multiple circles of various colors on a screen. For each subject, there were multiple trials in which the circles appeared in different positions and sizes on the screen. Subjects after seeing a number of trials were prompted to provide the mean size of each circle. In the first experiment, only two colors (red and blue) were tested, subjects were told to ignore green circles, and only remember the size of red and blue circles. In the second experiment, the green circles were removed all together and subjects were told simply to remember the overall size of the circles. In the first experiment, during the test phase it was shown that the subjects exhibited a bias to the ensemble statistic size depending on the color circle. In the second experiment, although only the mean size was requested of the subjects, when later asked to determine the average size of the red and blue circles independently, the subjects did so accurately regardless of the mean size. Additionally, in the second experiment the subjects were asked to size a black circle so that it could be tested if an ensemble statistic was stored in visual working memory of all the circles mean size independent of color. Statistically significant results indicated that in addition to being able to categorize the circles' sizes based on color, subjects showed bias approximating the average mean size of the circles overall when presented with the black circle.
      </p>
      <p>
        These results greatly support my research question in showing that if we assume a prototypal nature of visual working memory, there can be noted hierarchy at multiple levels of the prototypes. Information within visual working memory, as with linguistic working memory as seen with my first article, and long-term memory with my second article, is naturally hierarchically categorized. This study suggest that working memory is susceptible to dependence between items and hierarchical organization in the same way that long-term memory is constructive and hierarchical. This implies that working-memory is constructive in a bottom-up fashion in acquisition and de-constructive in a top-down fashion in regards to ensembles statistic recall.

      </div>
      <p>
        This study analyzed the nature of hierarchal coding both from a perceptual view and from a memory level in regards to spatial layouts. Participants were presented with a spatial layout of houses labeled A-R in arbitrary positions. Subjects were asked to estimate the distance between the houses presented in both perceptual and memory conditions. In the perecpetual condition, subjects viewed the map while estimating the distances. In the memory condition, subjects had to remember the map of the houses and then answer the questions without the map. It was found that subjects just as readily showed hierarchal bias based on matched color of any given two houses both in the perceptual and memory sessions. The author claims that this implies that we should view the hierarchal structure present in cognition as an aspect of perception instead of an aspect of memory. Before an object can pass to working memory, it must first pass perception and the results of this study question whether it is working memory in fact imposing the hierarchical and associative nature of items or simply perception.
      </p>
      <p>
        These results diverge with all of my other introduced articles so far. This article suggest that hierarchy in cognition begins with perception rather than hierarchy being a property of the nature of our memory.  However, these results seem weak and unfounded. I think from the current study we cannot gauge which step the hierarchal organization of the houses took place in because to even recite back and be tested on the distance between the houses would imply even in the perceptual condition that the houses entered working memory.

      <p>
        This study compared both the efficiency and preference of subjects in a selection task using a grid of targets versus hierarchical organization of targets. Subjects were presented a selection in one instance in which targets were organized in a two-level hierarchical fashion and in another trial as a 5x5 grid. Selection in both the hierarchy and the grid took place on a small screen. In both trials, subjects were requested to select the target based on a clue, which mached only one item in the pool of 25 items. One such clue might be: "makes holes". Some of the possible 25 targets included: chisel, hammer, sander, baseball, golf, or drill. In the hierarchical organization: chisel, hammer, and sander were categorized as tools, while baseball and golf were categorized as sports. There were a total of 5 categories each with 5 nested items. It was found that users performed slower when presented with the 25 items organized in hierarchical fashion. However regardless, subjects indicated that they had a preference for the hierarchical organization in selection over viewing all 25 items at once.
 </p>
      <p>
        This study questions the need for hierarchies in option selection tasks and cognition all together. This converges with the other studies by noting that subjects have preference for hierarchy and it goes further to build on the nature of hierarchy in cognition. This study asserts that hierarchy is preferential of our cognition and may in certain instances be mal-adaptive or less efficient. Regardless, we must question to what affect the results from this study would generalize as only 25 items were presented. If presented some larger number of items, say 500, it is likely that not only would subjects prefer the hierarchical organization as seen with this study, but additionlly subjects would be more efficient utilzing hierarchical organization than viewing all 500 items at once in selction.
