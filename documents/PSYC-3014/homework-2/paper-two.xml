    <div id="title">Dissociative Identity Disorder in Fight Club</div>
    <div class="response">
      <p>
        Fight Club is a movie which portrays a individual suffering from disassociative identity disorder in only the way a Holywood movie could. The narrator, who remains nameless, experiences symptoms of dissociative identity disorder in which he experiences two distinct personalities. In one personality, the narrator is a nameless, faceless drone at the leash of consumers working for an automotive company. In the narrators other personality he is Tyler Durden: an eccentric, bold, societal-rebel, and anti-hero. From a psychological stand-point the narrator of Fight Club could most definetly said to be suffering from  disassociative identify disorder however, as I will explore throughout this paper, the narrators presence of the Tyler Durden personality suggest that in addition to DID the narartor must additionally suffer a comorbidity with X.

      <p>
        Firstly I will give a brief summary of the plot of Fight Club as to acquiant the reader with the context in which the narrator's diagnosis of a DID and X comorbidity could be asessed.  The movie introduces the narrator as  an insomniac, corporate drone, who holdsa desk job at an automobile company. The narrarator is drowning in consumerism, suffers from relentless insomnia, and find relief by attending a support group for testicular cancer. Norton meets a man by the name of Tyler Durden on a flight. After Norton's apartment explodes as a result of a burner he accidently left on, Norton calls Tyler and the two form a deep relationship after starting a fight. As the plot develops, the narrator moves into the abandoned house in which Tyler lives. The two men start a fight club operating out of the basement of a bar. The fight clu b welcomes all new members

        From a clinical psychology perspective, a diagnosis of diassociative personality disorder does not include the personalities being able to physically interact and have dillusions of one another. From this perspective Fight Club seems to have glorified disasdsociative personality disorder in a manner not accurate to the data. However it is not completly improbable for someone with DID to expierience symptoms similiair to the narrator of Fight Club. As such, dissassosicative personality disorder hsa a high rate of comorbidity with other disorder. Accordingly at the begining of the movie as we are introduced to the narrator he is suffering from insomnia

        An interesting note on the presence of disassociative personality disorder in the narrator of Fight Club is that the narrator's alternative identify, Tyler Durden, seems to embody the preseence of everything the narrator is not. THe narrator obviously has deep psychological problem which are explained in the movie as being caused by consumer and the declining masculalinty in modern society. As such Tyler Dureden is the rebel. Tyler Duren is everything that the narrator is not but wishes he could be. Tyler Durden is the yang to the narrator's ying.  In a transient state in the movie at the realization of his multiple personality, as Brad Pitt who plays Tyler Durden in the movie puts it: "I look like you wanna look, I fuck like you wanna fuck, I am smart, capable, and most importantly, I'm free in all the ways that you are not". Tyler Durden is the anti-hero, the rebel, and everything the narrator is not.
