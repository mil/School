Study Guide for Exam 1
======================
1. **Definitions/prototype of abnormality**
    - There is **no one behavior** making someone abnormal
    - Prototype includes: Suffering, maladaptiveness, deviancy
        * Violations of Social Standards, Social Discomfort, Irrationality, Social Judgment
2. **Dichtomous/continuous conceptualization of abnormality**
    - Is it a dichotomy to be abnormal or
    - Are people more or less abnormal/normal
3. **DSM-IV classification system – know axes**
    - **Axis I**: Clinical disorders
    - **Axis II**: Personality disorders, mental retardation
    - **Axis III**: General medical conditions
    - **Axis IV**: Psychosocial and enviromental problems
    - **Axis V**: Global assessment of functioning
4. DSM-IV definition of abnormality
    - A **NEED** behavioral or psychological syndrome or pattern
    - Associated with distress or disability
    - Not simply a predictable and culturally sanctioned response to a particular event
    - Considered to **reflect behavioral, psychological, or biological dysfunction** in the individual
5. How people with mental illness were treated (generally) during various time periods (i.e., Biblical times, Middle Ages, Early 20th Century, Late 20th Century)
    - Clergy, Asylums, Circulating Swing, Tranquilzing Chair.
    - Idea was that abnormal people must chose rationality over insanity
6. General information about prevalence – will not be asked specific statistics
    - Most Frequent: Anxiety Disotrders (includes phobias)
        * Then Substance abuse, then depression
    - Siginifigant gender differences:
        * Alchol abuse/dependence more common in men
        * Depression/anxiety more common in women, they are not going to develop scizo


7. Key terminology related to causes of abnormal behavior 
    - Risk Factors: Variables correlated with an abnormal outcome
    - **BLANK**: casual pattern of abnormal behavior

8. Concept of feedback and bidirectionality
    * We have diffucluty distinguishing between what is cause/effect
    * Effects can serve as feeback that can in turn influence the cause
    * Bidirectional relationship
9. 2 diathesis stress models
    * **Interactive** Model: 
        - Some amount of diathesis muyst be present before stress will have any effect
        - No genetive risk for developing Scizophernia, they are not going to develop scizo

    * **Additive** Model: 
        - Individuals who have a hight level of a diathesis may need only a small amount of stress before a disorder develops
10. Types of abnormalities in neurotransmitters related to mental disorders
    - Excessive production and relase of neurotransmitter substance into the synapses (cause excess)
    - Dsyfunction in **BLANK** once release (causes excess)
    - Problems with receptors in the postsynaptic neuron which may be either abormally sensitive or abnorally insenseitve
    - Different disorders thought to stem from different patterns of neurotransmitters abnormalities in various brain areas
    - Five different kinds of neurotransmitters been most extensivly studied in relation to psychopathology
        1. Norepinephrine
        2. Dopamine
        3. Setoronin
        4. Glutamate
        5. Gamma minobutyric Acid (GABA)
11. Methods for studying genetic influence
    - Family History/Pedigree method
        * Examine whteter incidence increases in proportion to the degree of heredity
        * Compare incidence of disorder in normal population
        * Limiation: those genetically related also share more similar enviroments
    - Twin Method
        * Examine **BLANK** rates among monozygotic twins
        * Examine rates of disorder in the adopted away offspring of biological parents who have a disorder
12. Freud’s psychodynamic view of abnormal behavior (i.e., subconscious, Id, Ego, Superego, concept of psychosexual stages, role of anxiety)
    - Emphasizes Ego and thought in relation to normal and abnormal behavior
    - Subconsious is like an iceberg
        * Id: Source of intisntual drives: first structure to develop after birth
        * Ego: MEdiate between id and super ego
        * Superego: Internalized taboos and morals of society
    - Conversion blindness, paralysis
    - Ego resorts to irrational protective measures when unconcous anxiety cannot be dealth with rationally
13. Classical conditioning and how it relates to the development and treatment of disorders
    - Classical Conditioning
        * Pariing onece nural stimulus
        * Extinction: If CS repeadatedly presented without UCS the conditioned resposne gradually extinguishes
            - Ex. Phobia of spiders

14. Be familiar with all behavioral concepts
    - Only study of directly observable behavior
    - Classical Conditioning
        * (an assocation between two different stimuli, reinforcer + desired response)
        * Pariing onece nural stimulus
        * Extinction: If CS repeadatedly presented without UCS the conditioned resposne gradually extinguishes
            - Ex. Phobia of spiders
        * CS = Spider, Bites UCS
    - Instrumental COnditiong
        * Indviduals learn how to acheieve a desired goal
            - New responses learned if they **BLANK instrumental?**
        * Not used for anxiety disorders (teaching a dog a trick)
15. Understand Cognitive Behavioral perspective (e.g., role of thoughts)
    - Generally focuses on how thoughts and info processing can become distorted and maldaptive emotions and behavior
    - Central issue is how best to alter **BLANK cognitions?**
    - Client's self-statements - what their clients say to themselves by way of interpreting their experiences
    - Schemas are sources of psychological vulnerability if distorted or maldaptive
    - We tend to work new expressions into our existing cognitive frameworks (assimiliation)
    - **BLANK** is a goal of CBT
16. Know main sociocultural causal factors
    - Lower the Socioeconomic status, the hight the incident of mental disorders
    - Unemployment associated with emotional distress, vulnerability to psychopathology
    - Discriminiation predicts lower levels of well being for women
    - Prejudice against minority may explain why groups sometimes show increaded prevelance of mental disorders such as depression
