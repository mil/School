Defining Abnormality
====================
- **Basics**
    * Abnormality - Dichotomy or Continuum?
    * Abnormal Behavior is Normal?
        - **Compulsions**: Repeated unwanted acts or rituals 
        - **Obsessions**: Repeated unwanted thoughts 
        - **Delusions**: False beliefs 
        - **Phobias**: Exaggerated, unrealistic fears of speciﬁc objects or events 
        - Superstitions/rituals 
- A **Prototype of Abnormality**
    * There is **no one behavior** making someone abnormal
    * The text suggests the following elements in a "prototype" of abnormality
        - Suffering
        - Maldaptiveness
        - Deviancy (with value judgements)
        - Violations of standards of society
        - Social Discomfort
        - Irrationality and Unpredictibility
        - Social Judgment (based on values and ecisins of society)A
- **Suffering**
    * Examples: 
        - Depression and Anxiety
    * Neither necessary nor sufficient for behavior to be considered abnormal
        - Someone in the manic phase of biopolar disorder
        - Loss of family member
- **Maladaptiveness**
    * Examples:
        - Person with anoxeria restricts food intake so much she must be hostpitalized
        - Person with social anxiety unable to make friends at school or give class presentation
        - Person with depression unable to get out of bed
        - Person with agoraphobia unable to leave house
- **Deviancy**
    * Statistically rare or away from the norm
    * We make value judgments
        - Itelligcence
        - Athleticism
- **Violations of Standards of Society**
    * Violations of norms and social standards
    * Depends on **NEED** and how commonly violated by others
        - Speeding tickets (violation of law but commonly violated)
        - "butting" in line (not violation of law and usually not violated)
        - Recent example at graduation ceremony
- **Social Discomfort**
    * When someone **violates a rule** those around may feel **uneasy**
    * Examples:
        - "Urinal Etiquette"
        - Personal Space
        - Talking about personal amtters after just meeting
- **Irrationality and Unpredictability**
    * Someone screaming out obscenities
    * Example from hospital: hyper sexuality
- **Abnormal behavior across time**
    * Tattoos
    * Homosexuality (considered mental illness in DSM-II until 1964; sexual orientation "disturbance" was removed in 1987)
    * Women in workplace/women in more traditionally masculine roles
- How does culture affect what is abnormal?
    * Superstitions
    * Variations in expression
        - Local Appalachian culture - going to "root doctor"
        - Native Americans - focus on somatic symptoms (body aches), sleep problems
        - China - focus on somatic symptoms (dizziness, headache)
    * **Culture specific disorders**
        - Tajin kyofusho - feat that body parts or body functionins may offend, embarass, or may others feel uncomfortable; fear of blushing, upsetting by gaze, facial expressions or body odor
- DSM-IV
    * Accepted standard for defining various types of mental disorder.
    * Does not classify disorders based upon etiology - rather clusters of symptoms taht often occur together
    * DSM based on multi-axial classification system
    * When a formal diagnosis is made, client rated on 5 separate dimensions or axes
        - Axis I : Clinical disorders
        - Axis II : Personality disorders, mental retardation
        - Axis III : General medical conditions
        - Axis IV: Psychosocial and enviromental problems
        - Axis V: Global assessment of functioning
    * Definition of Abnormality
        - DSM-IV Definition of Mental Disorders
            * A **NEED** behavioral or psychological syndrome or pattern
            * Associated with distress or disability
            * Not simply a predictable and culturally sanctioned response to a particular event
            * Considered to **reflect behavioral, psychological, or biological dysfunction** in the individual
- Reason for Classification
    * Provides a naming system
    * Allows us to study and learn more about cuases of disorders
    * Assists in deciding upon appropriate treatment
    * Social and Political Implications:
        - Which types of psychological diffuculties warrant reimbursement
