    * Question:
        - Leibniz argues senses are necessary but not sufficient for knowledge of the truth.
        - What must be added to the senses for knowledge of truth?
    * Response:
        - The senses are necessary in the sense that they provide instances
        - However, these instances cannot be said to be sufficient
        - Just these instances cannot lead us to the truth because
            * We cannot say that what has hppaned will always happen the same way
        - Emperical givens don't give you knowledge
            * You need primary truths which are obtained by a priori reasoning
- B
    * Question:
        - What is the difference between Locke's reflection and Leibniz's Reflection?
    * Response:
        - Locke's Reflection:
            * Empericist
            * We have certain senses that form ideas within our minds
            * We then reflect on those ideas to form new ideas
            * Theses reflections on ideas originate in our mind
                - But are caused originally by the senses
            * Reflection is **a tool** to **evaluate emperical givens**
        - Leibniz's Reflection:
            * Rationalist
            * Still refelct on experience
            * Reflection gets us turths about ourselves / reason
            * **Reason yeilds truths about reality/being**
        - Difference is what reflection / reason gives us access to
- C

    * Question:
    * Response:
        - Monads
        - Every substance is created is not seperate from the rest of the world
        - These is a unity. Its internal principles reflect everything that goes on outside the world
        - Every stubstance contains the principles of what it is
            * It also contains everything about what it is  not
