Boyle
-----
- Mechanism/Corpuscularianism
    * Setup:
        - Consists of two princiles:
            * Matter
                - Size, Shape, Orientation
            * Motion
                - Can break up, impart motion onto other bodies
        - Local Motion: All changes ultimatly are the result of change of place
        - Corpuscularian: Avoid question of existence of atoms (indivisible bodies)
        - Believed God was cause:
            * Arranged matter
            * Imparted motion to matter
            * Established "rules of motion" (laws of nature)
    * Backup
        - "Intelligbleness or clearness of mechanical principles and explanations"
            * Everything can be broken down into smaller bits
        - Principles fundamental chronologically and conceptually
            * Chronologically: Universe couldn't begin without both matter & motion
            * Conceptually: Both matter and motion are irreduicble simple concepts
        - Universiality/Comprehensive (Infinite Divisibility)
            * Everything can be explained in terms of matter and motion
            * It is universally generalizable
            * Rock -> Pebble -> Some Small visible particle -> Some non-observable particle
            
- Opponent Theory: Epicurean Theory
    * Atoms swerving in the void
    * Atoms are the fundamental unit of the universe
    * These atoms hit one another and accidentally produce all phenomenon in universe
    * Addresses question of how are matter and motion related to the universe as a system
    * Why can we explain everything in matter and motion, what we cannot explain...

- Main Objection to Mechanist View
    * Objection:
        - Chemical systems can explain principles differently from mechanical laws
        - Chemists can appeal to composite substances and their principles
        - Different elements have different proprites
        - Some create fire, some boil at a certain tempreature, others have properties
        * Sulfure, Mecurcyr, Salt, etc.....
    * Reply:
        - These are not fundamental and satisfactory explanations
        - These chemical reactions can be broken down into the Corpuscularian view
            * These reactions are results of matter being changed by motion
        - Chemical systems can be explained in terms of matter/motion
