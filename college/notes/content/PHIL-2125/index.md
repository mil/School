This course will focus on four themes in seventeenth and eighteenth century philosophy: knowledge, physics, metaphysics, and mind.  All four are the subjects of chapters in a survey text by Anthony Kenny, The Rise of Modern Philosophy. In working through the material, we will read the original texts that Kenny is discussing, which are reprinted in the Modern Philosophy anthology. We will compare and examine the contributions to debates on these issues by Descartes, Berkeley, Locke, Leibniz, Spinoza, Hume, and others.
 
The center of the course will be in-class discussion, including talking about response papers that students will prepare ahead of time based on the readings. If you are not prepared to engage in significant discussion in class, and to come to class prepared, this is probably not the course for you.
 
The Scholar site will be the meeting place for course communication, including submitting essays and assignments.  Please familiarize yourself with Scholar, and with the course site, if you haven’t done so before.

Course Policies
Again, as a philosophy course, this class will involve significant discussion and debate. For such discussion to be productive, it must be civil and respectful. Students are expected to observe the rules of courtesy and respect for each other and for the instructors. Students in the course are expected to behave as students: to approach the readings with curiosity and interest, to discuss and to write about the assigned topics with regard to their intellectual significance, and to take seriously, and to learn from, criticism of their work on assignments. The professor and GTA of the course reserve the right to assess grade penalties, or to respond more severely if appropriate, if a student does not meet these expectations. These expectations include, but are not restricted to, the VT Principles of Community and Code of Student Conduct.
 
Late assignments without a valid excuse lose 30 points per day, where weekends count as two days. Assignments can be submitted on the Scholar site only.  If you miss more than two class meetings for a non-emergency reason, 40 points per absence over two will be deducted from your final grade. Emergencies are defined by Virginia Tech policy, please ask for details.
 
All essays must include a “Works Cited” list, bibliography, or full bibliographical information in the footnotes, in the MLA or in the Chicago Manual of Style format.
 
Plagiarism is not giving a reference for any quotation; not giving a reference for any idea or argument that is not your own, even when paraphrasing; submitting work submitted for another course, even at another university; or turning in work written for you by someone else. This includes copying and pasting, or even paraphrasing, summaries of arguments or ideas found on the Internet without identifying and citing your source. If you find a useful source on the Internet, just cite it! Many tools are available on the web to show you how to cite an Internet source.
 
Plagiarism is cheating. It imperils your grade and your academic career, and will be dealt with according to university policy. The first, and mildest, consequence is that you will fail the assignment, and possibly the course, depending on the severity of the offense. The teaching staff may report the incident to the University if it is severe enough, or if there has been more than one offense. Please ask if you have questions about what counts as cheating. All students must make Virginia Tech’s Honor Pledge when submitting assignments.
 
If you are registered with the OSD, or if you need assistance in case of the building’s being evacuated, please let the professor and the GTA know at the beginning of the term.
 
Email Policy
1.              Please call me Dr. Patton or Professor Patton (for now).
2.              Please don’t send me, or your GTA, email about the course material. Email is to ask questions about the syllabus or requirements, or to make an appointment for office hours. During that appointment, you can ask any questions you have about the material.

Special Essay Note
If you have not written philosophy essays before, please take the “Philosophical Writing” module, available on the Scholar site. It will test you on thesis statement construction, on argument, and on essay structure—essentially, on the conventions for philosophy essays. Please make sure you can pass this module (the grade does not count for your final grade) before you begin writing essays for this course.
Grading Criteria For Essays
More specific instructions will be distributed with the essay topics, and students are responsible for following all of these instructions. Failure to do so will have consequences for the essay grade.
 
AThe essay has a strong thesis statement, as defined in the “Philosophical Writing” module—for all essays, you are responsible for material in this module!  Substantial evidence (quotations) from the texts is given to support the claims in the essay; evidence is relevant to the assigned topic and is cited properly. The explanation of how the argument works, and the reasoning in support of your thesis, is clear and easy to follow even by someone who has not read the assigned text. The representation of the arguments from the texts is accurate.

BThe essay has a weaker thesis statement. There is some evidence from the texts to support the claims in the essay, but it is not relevant to the assigned topic OR is not cited properly. The explanation of how the argument works, and the reasoning in support of the thesis, would not be easy to follow by someone who hasn’t read the assigned text. There may be slight inaccuracies in the representation of the arguments.

CThe essay has a weak thesis statement. There is little evidence from the texts to support the claims in the essay. The explanation of how the argument works, or the reasoning in support of the thesis, is not easy to follow, especially by someone who has not read the assigned text. Alternatively, the essay just re-states the argument without explaining how it works. The representation of the arguments from the texts is not accurate.
Note: Any two of these criteria are enough to put an essay into the “C” class.

DThere is no discernible thesis statement. There is no or almost no valid evidence from the texts to support the claims in the essay (“invalid”: the evidence is irrelevant to the assigned topic OR is misquoted OR is improperly cited). The essay is unclear, rambling, or disconnected. There is no recognizable representation of the arguments from the texts.

Note: Any one among these criteria is enough to put an essay into the “D” class.

FThe student submitted nothing relevant to the assigned topic or submitted nothing at all.
