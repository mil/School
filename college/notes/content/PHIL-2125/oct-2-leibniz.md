- Axiomatic Method
    * Overview:
        - Definitions
        - Rules for Inference
        - Draw Conclusions
    * This is largely conventional
- Leibniz Axioms
    * A = A -> Any Invividual
    * A = ~~A
    * If A = B -> [
        - ~[A = ~B]
        - ~[A != B]
    * ]
- Syntax Versus Semantics
    * Syntax:
        - Conventional Rules
    * Semantics:
        - Meaning of The Constructed Sentences
- Necessary Truths versus Necessary Thurths
    * Necessary Truth
        - Primary Truth
        - An inference form a primary truth without referring & emprical givents
    * Continent Truth
        - Depends on empircal givens
- A Priori
    * Primary and necessary truths for Leibniz are ll apriori
- Identity of Indiscernibles
    * Two individiuals are distrinct individuals only if there is one property that one individual that the other doesn't

- Primary Truths
    * Truths about way the mind works independent of any empirical given
    * Laws about how our minds work
    * Axiomatic
    * Basics of the system of knowledge
    * Examples
        - A = A
        - A != ~A
- Identity of Indescrinibles
    * THere cannot be two indidivudals that differ only in number ; they must differ in at leaset one property

- Principles of Individuation (Principle of Sufficient Reason)
    * Every subsatnce (individual) has a **principle** that distinguishes it frome very other.
