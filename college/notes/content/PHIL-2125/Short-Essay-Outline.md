====================
1. "Man is not provided with all the natural senses"
2. Each Sense provides a unique amount of knowledge
    - It is impossible to understand one sense from another sense
3. The Senses are uncertain and falsifiable in all circumstances

1) The scope of our knowledge is limited to what the senses provide us with.
2) Each sense is unique and can only be understood first-hand
3) The human senses are not necessarily all of the senses
4) The senses are un-reliable and falliable
5) Our senses often contradict with reason
6) Our senses have the ability to command our reason and soul
7) Our senses are often stupified by the passion of the soul
8) Senses can contradict one another
    - The same stimuli can be interpreted by different senses radically different
    - Even our own senses: Musk smells good and tastes bad
9) Our condition alter what our senses alter percieve
