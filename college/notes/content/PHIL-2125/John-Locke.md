John Locke : Essay concerning Human Understanding
=================================================

Chapter I
---------
- First Locke wants to distinguish two ways of going about his task, which is "to inquire into the origin, certainty, and extent of human knowledge" (316):
    * Psychological
        - "The Physical Consideration of the mind" and the considerations of how it comes to have ideas, beliefs, and feelings (316)
    * Epistemological
        - "Consider the discerning faculties of a man insofar as they are employed about the objects which they have to do with" (316)

Locke's Method
---------------
1. "Inquire into the origin of those ideas... which a man observes and is consious to himself he ahs in mind" (317). Notice that this "origin" cannot be a phsyical origin, that is, this is not empirical psychology (see above)
2. "Inquire what knowledge th understanding has by those ideas, and the certainty, evidence, and extent of it" (317)
3. "Make some inquiry into the nature and ground of faith and opinion" (317)

- The goal of all this: "Useful to know the extent of our comprehension". Read this section carefully; its fairly lear.
- The point is that many people "affect" (this means preted) to know about things that they couldn't know, if we were to be aware of and to respect the limitations of the human powers of knowledge.
- So, Locke says, he is going to investigate those powers, so he can find their limits, but also what they allows us to know.
- Again when Locke says "powers", he doesn't mean physical abilities of the mind!
- Interpretative question. Locke wants to investigate the knowlege it is possible for us to have, by investigating the "powers" of the mind that give rise to the knowledge we actually have
    * How is this possible?
    * What's the problem with this, if you're a rationalist?

Chapter II - No Innate Principles in the Mind
---------------------------------------------
1. It is possible for people to "attain all the knowledge they have" without appealing to innate ideas (319)
    - If we have sight and the power to "recieve" color information from objects, why would we ned an innate idea of color?
2. **Rationalist Argument** (not Locke's): General assent. People assent "universall" to all sorts of principles and ideas. If we were just randmly acquiring information from our surroundings, then (according to the rationalist) there woudln't be such widespread agreement to these principles (319).
    - *Locke's Response*: First the world is the same world for everyone, so why is it suprising people agree on some things? Second, its not actulaly ture that there is universal argument, as you find when you investigate other cultures for instance (319).
3. Locke's argument: what about children and those with impaired intellectual powers? If ideas were innate in every human, if they came as standard equipment, then children and the intellectually impaired would posses these ideas too, but they don't (319).
    - Rationalist counterargument: there is such a thing as the "age of reason", where children attain knowledge of innate ideas (Locke reports on p.320)
    - Locke's Response: But this leaves it open that you need to use reason to discover these "innate" truths. That seems wrong. Reason is an ability to discover consequences to make inferences, to find out things you didn't already know. But the whole point of the "innate ideas" argument is that you did already know these ideas, so why do you need to discover them?(320)
