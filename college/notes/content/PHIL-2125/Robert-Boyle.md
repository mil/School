Matter
------
"one catholic or unviersal matter common to all bodies, by which I mean a substance extended, dividsible, and impenertrable" (Forms and Qualities, Works III, p. 15, p.18, quoted in Peter Anstey's PHilosophy of RObert Boyl p. 41). So there is only ONE matter, not several - i.e, the matter in fire and the matter in water are the same, just determined differentlyy. THis might be called the homogeneeeity of matter

Motion
-------
Boyle was aware of Zeno's paradoxes, which question wheterh motion exists at all, that is wheter it is a real feature of the world, not just an illusion. Boyle though the concept of motion was diffucult to define and didn't really make his own contribution to this (Anstey 117). He thinks all motion is "local" motion, that is, change in place in space.

Epicureans (Lucretius)
----------------------
Atoms swerving in the void randomly and ccidently produce all the phenonmenon of the unvierse.

Deism (Descartes)
-----------------
Once God had created the universe and endowed matter with "unguided" motion, he didn't need to do anything more to make a "system" of nature (o.e didnt need to intervene further or impose any laws on nature)

THe philisophyuical question the Epicureans and the Deist are addressing is the question of how explation in tmers of matter and motion are releated to tje universe as a system. We know that we observe what we take to be matterial objects and their motions. But why do we think that we can understand or explain anything that happens? Why is it not simply random swerving?

Boyle's Position
----------------
Bottom of page 308: "THe philosphy I plead for reaches only to purely corpoeral things; and distinguishing between the first origin of things and the subsequent course of nature teaches that God indeed gave motion to matter, but that in the beginning he so guided the various motion of the parts of it as to contrive them into the world he design they should compose, and established those rules of motion and that order among the coporeal things which we call the laws of nature"
This is the first step.
Then:
308-309: "Thus the universe being once framed | by God, and he laws of motion sttled and all upheld by his perpetual concourse and genral providence, the same philosphy teaches that the phenomena of the world are physically produced by the mechianical propties of the parts of matter, and that they operate upon on another according to mechianical laws."

The first reason to accpet his principle is the carlity of its principles (309)

Here, the reasons are against the Peripatetics, whom we havn't studyeid. But essentially, Boyle argues that he can give explanaitons where other have to "fly to principles". For instance, concave mirror projection.

Another argument for clarity: "There cannot be any physical principles more simple than matter and motion, neither of them being resoluble to any other thing"; and "there cannot be fewer principles than... matter and motion" (both, 309)

Second argument is the xtensiveness of the explanations you can derive from matter and motion (310).

Left column: Some philosophers argue that epxlanations in terms of matter and motion are useful and extensive, but they still argue that the "natures" or essences, "Substantial forms", and so forth of macrosopic bodies are not mechanical, but nonetheless real. In other words, they deny that microscopic (possibly unobserved) bodies are the cause of the observed phenomena, rather than the nature or form of the observable.

Boyle responds that composite bodies, motions, and effects (phenomena) are governed by exactly the same laws as their components (310, right hand column). A pebble and a large rock fall according to the same law of acceleration.

This means that we can continue the explanation according to a ration
Large rock : pebble :: visbe body :: invisible components

Page.312 Objection to corpusculariniams : I have anther system, which is better (chmical) This system appeals ot physical prinipcles which are different from the mechanical laws

Chemists appeal to composite substances and their "pciniples" or laws, such as sulphyr, etc.

Boyle admits this. "I willingly grant that salt, sulfur, and mecury, or some substances analogous to them, are obstainbel by the action of the fire froma very great many bodies able to be dissapated here below" (312).

But he says explantions of this kind "are not he most fundamnetal and satisfactoru", "for the cemical ingredient itself, wheter sulfur or any other, must owe its nature and other qualities to the union of insensible particles in a convient size, shape, motion, or rest and texture, all which are but mehcniacal propties of conveing corpulscles (312).

Conclusions
-----------
Matter and motion are the onlyt ruly real things, and the laws that govern them are the fundamental basics and exhaustive laws of nature.

ALl explanations must be reducible to explanations in terms of matter, motion, and mechanical laws, or they are not "fundamental and satisfactory"

The only real qualities of bodies are descriptions of the amtter they container [Motion???]
