Formal Foundationalism
----------------------
- Normative/Evaluative supervenes on something non-normative/evalutative
- Simple Hedonism (Theory of Value)
    * What is *Good*? --> Pleasure 
        - (Good == Normative/Evaluative) 
        - (Pleasure != Normative)
    * Fix Pleasure Facts -->  Fixes the Goodness Facts
- Foundationalists and Coherenetists are trying to give a non-normative grounding to justification (which is normative)
    * Justification Supervenes on:  
        - Content of the Belief
        - Reliablity of the mechanism that led to the belief
        - Basis perception, memory, interence
- Doxastic Ascent Arguments
    * Foundationalist: Basic Bliefs justifed by having property P
    1. To be justified in believing basic belief B, you must believe that belief B has property P
        - (But then B isn't a baisc belief, its justified by another belief) <- a meta-belief
    2. To be justified in believing basic belief B, you must believe that Belief B is not the kind of belief your likely to be wrong about.
        - There must be no defeaters

Coherentism
-----------
- As a superevenience thesis:
    * Justification supervenes on membership in a large, coherent set of beliefs
- Example:
    * A) I have a headache
    * B) I am in pain
    * A&B Cohere with all your other beliefs --- Justified
    * If you were to flip these to the exact opposite ~A && ~B, looks like these will cohere just as well
        - Justified in believing (p), justified believing (~p)

Problems for Existing Foundationalism
-------------------------------------
- Beliefs about the world are at least partly justified by sensory experience
- Belief(There is a chalk board) depends on sensory experiencej
    * This depends must be more than causation (Bonjour: Beliefs about sensory Experience)
    * Either make snsory justifcation pricniples fundamental or derived.
    * GO on dervived route
        - Sen Exp (r) -> Bel (r thing exists)
        - All X Sen Exp(x) -> Bel (x thing exists)
            * This is only contingent, true in our world

Virtue Epistomology
-------------------
- Justification is in first plae a property of dispisitions/virtues.
- Derviativly: Justification apllieds to beliefes by the dispositions that produce them
