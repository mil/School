Infinitism
==========
- Basics
    * The structure of reasons is infinite; 
    * If any beliefs are justified there is an infinite chain of reasons that justify the belief
    * Infinitivism denied the inifinite regress
        - The Infinite Regress
            * If any belief is justified, the regress of reasons must end in some way
- Based on Two Principles:
    * Principle of Avoiding Arbitrariness
        - If S has a justification for x, then there is some reason (r1) available to S for x, and there is some reason (r2) available to S for r, etc...
        - Run into problem that foundatalists run into
    * Principle of Avoiding Circularity
        - If S has justifcation for x ^ y is in the evidential ancestory of x for S, the x is not in the evidential ancestory of y for S.
        - r -> p
        - q -> r
