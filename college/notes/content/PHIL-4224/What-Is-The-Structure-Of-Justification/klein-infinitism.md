Infinitism
==========
- Basics
    * The structure of reasons is infinite; 
    * If any beliefs are justified there is an infinite chain of reasons that justify the belief
    * Infinitivism denied the inifinite regress
        - The Infinite Regress
            * If any belief is justified, the regress of reasons must end in some way
- Based on Two Principles:
    * Principle of Avoiding Arbitrariness
        - If S has a justification for x, then there is some reason (r1) available to S for x, and there is some reason (r2) available to S for r, etc...
        - Run into problem that foundatalists run into
    * Principle of Avoiding Circularity
        - If S has justifcation for x ^ y is in the evidential ancestory of x for S, the x is not in the evidential ancestory of y for S.
        - r -> p
        - q -> r


- Challenges to PAA (Principle of Avoiding Arbitrariness)
    1. Reliablism: justification doesn't requrie reasons

    2. Meta-Beliefs: Some beliefs may be justified by having some property, not by having a reason to bealve them
    3. Arbitrariness isn't so bad
        * (Becasue necessary)
        * Why?
        * Ultimate Epistemic Goal: Complete & Accurate understading of the world
        * If you believe everything then there is no porbabilyt of complete & accurate (only complete maybe)
        * If you have some foundations then your may get a complete & accurate picture
        * Klein Response: This is prudential justification, not epistemic, -- means/ends type justification
            - Prudential - just doing things to help you acheieve goals, just a means to a goal

- Infinitism and Skepticism
    * If x is justified then theres an infinite chain of reason
    * If infinitism is right you can never "settle" an issue
        - Sure but you can have provisional reasons
           * Worry: But you coan't rule out skepticism
