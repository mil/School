Bonjour - Toward a Defense of Empirical Foundationalism
=======================================================
Setup 
-----
1. Coherentist challenge to the possibility of basic beliefs
2. A possible escape for the foundationalist
3. Independently motivating theory of consciousness
4. Applying to empirical beliefs

Stopping the Regress 
--------------------
- Necessary for avoiding Skepticism
- Foundationalism 
    * Requires: Basic/Foundational Beliefs
    * Justified (but not by any other belief)
    * You have reason to think them true
        - But not by cirtue of believing anything else
- Possible Foundations (Self-Justifying Beliefs)
    * Perceptual Beliefs
    * (Awareness of) Perceptual Beliefs --> Sensory Experience ^
        - Belief-Like
            * Not a Regress Stopper
            * Needs Justification
        - Non-Cognitive 
            * Can't Justify

Emperical Foundationalism
-------------------------
- **Meta-Beliefs**: Beliefs about what you believe
    * Meta-beliefs are justified independently (foundationalist)
    * Example:
        - Belief: Will believes he's a student
        - Meta-Belief: Will believs that he believes he's a student
- Two Theories of Consciousness
    * Higher-Order Thought
        -In order for any belief to be conscious -- it needs to be couched
            * Saying that your a studnet is not necessarily conscious
            * For a belief to become concsious
        - Bonjour Reply:
            * A -> B -> C : Concious belief must be justified by belief
            * Causes infinite progress of beliefs
    * Bonjour's Consciousness
        - Any belief has two parts
            * Awareness of Content + Awareness you are Experienceing Belief
- Why are Meta-Beliefs Justified?  
    1. **Awareness of Content**
    2. **Awareness of Attitude**
