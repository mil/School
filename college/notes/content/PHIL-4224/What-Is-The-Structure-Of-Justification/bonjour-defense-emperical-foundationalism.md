Bonjour - Toward a Defense of Empirical Foundationalism
=======================================================
Setup 
-----
1. Coherentist challenge to the possibility of basic beliefs
2. A possible escape for the foundationalist
3. Independently motivating theory of consciousness
4. Applying to empirical beliefs

Stopping the Regress 
--------------------
- Necessary for avoiding Skepticism
- Foundationalism 
    * Requires: Basic/Foundational Beliefs
    * Justified (but not by any other belief)
    * You have reason to think them true
        - But not by cirtue of believing anything else
- Possible Foundations (Self-Justifying Beliefs)
    * Perceptual Beliefs
    * (Awareness of) Perceptual Beliefs --> Sensory Experience ^
        - Belief-Like
            * Not a Regress Stopper
            * Needs Justification
        - Non-Cognitive 
            * Can't Justify

Emperical Foundationalism
-------------------------
- **Meta-Beliefs**: Beliefs about what you believe
    * Meta-beliefs are justified independently (foundationalist)
    * Example:
        - Belief: Will believes he's a student
        - Meta-Belief: Will believs that he believes he's a student
- **Two Theories of Consciousness**
    * Higher-Order Thought
        -In order for any belief to be conscious -- it needs to be couched
            * Saying that your a studnet is not necessarily conscious
            * For a belief to become concsious
        - Bonjour Reply:
            * A -> B -> C : Concious belief must be justified by belief
            * Causes infinite progress of beliefs
    * Bonjour's Consciousness
        - Any belief has two parts
            * Awareness of Content + Awareness you are Experienceing Belief
- Why are Meta-Beliefs Justified?  
    1. **Awareness of Content**
    2. **Awareness of Attitude**
- Basic Beliefs (foundations) are possible because Meta-Beliefs are basic beliefs
- Beliefs about (sensory expierence) (conciosious state)
    * The sensory experience has awareness of some content 
- Conceptual vs. NonConceptual
    * Conceptional:
        - Non-Propositional
    * Non-Conceptual:
        - Propositional
        - Sensory Experience
- Problem: Sensory expierence is non-propositional so it can't justify
    * Snsory experiece are descriptions of the nonconeptula content in conceptula terms

Model that Motives Bonjour
---------------------------
- Belief that apples are in season
    1. Awareness of attitude toward some content
        - Bonjours analysis of what it is to have a conscious belief ^
    2. Awareness of the content that apples are in season
         - ----(justifies)--> Belief that I believe that apples are in season (Basic Belief) (Meta Belief)
- Justification for meta-beliefs is not your observation of your own mind
    * Justification for own mind is that you are not observering and making inferences
    * Justifiaction is the conscious thought

- Sensory experience of this room -> Awareness of a certain non-conceptual content
    * Basic Belief -> Belief that I'm having a sensory experience of ...
    * The way the world affects you is not conceptual

- Beliefs about Sensory Experience ----(how could it justify?)---> Beliefs about the External Worl
- Possibilities for such justification
    1. Physical world concepts are just sensory concepts
        * Response: Don't have phenomonelaist language
    2. Having an experience of x makes the existence of x more probable
    3. Bonjour's Favorite Route:
        - Physical Objects provide the best explanations of your sensory experience
