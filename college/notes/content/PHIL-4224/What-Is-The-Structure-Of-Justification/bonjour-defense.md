1st Part
--------
- Coherentist
    * What does coherence have to do with truth?
- Foundationalist
    * Davidson: Foundationalist has no response to the skeptic
        - Either fails or collapses to coherentist view
    * Relation between sensations and beliefs
        - (beliefs) Some class of perceptual beliefs
        - ? Sensations **are** beliefs
- Justification -> Cause -> Belief
    * Cause = Senses?
    * What comes before the cause,
    * Must look for justification in the meaning of what your believing

- The problem for the foundationalist is that confrontation between belief & truth/world
    * Davidson:There is no difference between belief and truth...
    * Truth and belief do not come apart
    * By their nature, beliefs are true
- Beliefs by their nature are ture and coherent
    * Are false beliefs possible?
        - Yes, part of beliefs is that it is possible for t/f
        - But by having a belief, it is implied it is true
- Belief is defined w/in interpretation & coherent
    * Interpretation requires principle of charity possible?
    * Charity requires truth
    * So, belief requires truth
