Justified True Belief Theory of Knowledge (Ayer)
------------------------------------------------
- **What is knowledge according to the justified true belief theory**? In particular, explain **why true belief is not good enough for knowledge**.
    * **Justified True Belief**
        - A **Belief that is True + Justification**
        - Example:
            * Man standing under a ladder, 
            * Believes that ladder will fall on him
            * Turns out that this is true
            * But how did he know? (Need Justification)
    * Justification: What takes a true belief and makes it knowledge
        - How does a man who makes consistly correct lottery # guesses differ from the man who actually knows the lottery #s
        - Knowledge = The Right to be Sure
            * If you hold a true belief, that does not necessarily ensure you the right to be sure
            * You can be right about something for the wrong reason

Gettier
-------
- **Give an example of a Gettier case and explain why it shows that the Justified True Belief analysis of knowledge is incorrect.**
    * Smith and Jones applied for a certain job.
    * Smith has strong evidence for:
        - J & C
        - J = Jones is the man who will get the job
        - C = Jones has ten coins in his pocket
    * Given J & C, P entails
        - P =  The man who will get the job has ten coins in his pocket
    * As it turns out, Smith himself will get the job and infact he himself (although unknown to him) has 10 coins in his pocket
        - Thus, P is true
        - Smith is jusified in the logical entailment of J & C -> P
        - But since J & C were actually both false, Smith fails to know that P
- **Given an example of a Gettier case that does not depend on the subject making an inference. Explain why it shows the Justified True Belief analysis of knowledge is incorrect.**
    * A man walks past a clock at 3:14. As it turns out, however unknown to the man, the clock is broken. But it just so happens that it indeed is 3:14. In this case the man is both justified in beliving it is 3:14 as the clock is almost always certainly correct. In addition his belief turned out to be true. However, the JTB account of knowledge fails here because regardless of the man being justified and the belief being true, it being 3:14 is not knowledge because if he were to talk by the clock at any other time he would have a justified false belief.

Lehrer
------
- **According to Lehrer, we cannot escape Gettier problems simply by requiring that a belief is not based on a false belief. Why not? That is, give an example of a case in which you have a belief that is at least in part based on a false belief, but is still knowledge and explain why it is still knowledge.**
    * You look out the window and see a bird hopping around and chirping in the yard. Consequently, you form the justified belief that there is a bird in the yard. As it turns out the bird is actually a robot put together by a crafty engineering student. However, there was actually a bird in the yard hiding behind a tree. In this case you have a justified belief that is true and thus is knowledge. Even though you came about this knowledge in the wrong way in that your true belief was based on a false belief (the bird you saw was real), you still know that there is a bird in the yard because it is a justified true belief.
- What is Lehrer’s proposed account of knowledge? How does it avoid the kind of problem that Gettier pointed raised for the JTB analysis of knowledge? How does it avoid the problems that face an account of knowledge that is JTB+Belief is not based on any false beliefs?
    * If S is completly justified in believing any false statement p which entails (but is not entailed by) h, then S would be compelty justified in beliving h even if S were to suppose that p is false. In the case with the bird, since both p entails h and h entails p, the fourth condition to knowledge would not be satisfied and thus you would not be able to say that you knew that you had knowledge.

Nozick
------
- What is sensitivity to falsity?
    * S knows that p when
        - p is true
        - S belives that p
        - if p were true, S would belive that p
        - If p weren't true, then S wouldn't believe that p
    * Sensitivity to falsity works such that your belief is strongly tied to its truth-tracking value. S's belief that p must be such that if p weren't true, S would believe that ~p
- Why is a true belief that is sensitive to falsity not always knowledge? Can you describe a case in which someone has a true belief that is sensitive to falsity but that is not knowledge? Explain why it is not knowledge.
    * Suppose you look up into the sky and see that its blue. Based on what you see, form the belief that the sky is in fact blue. But suppose, the sky is not actually blue but it is merely an illusion created by someone. Your sensitivity to falsility would prevent you from **knowing** that the sky is blue. 
    * However, take this same case and apply 3 & 4. If the sky were not blue, you would still believe the sky were blue. Thus your belief is not setnsitive to falsity.
    If you were not to truth track, say you are not seeing the sky but an illusion put before you. You would not know the sky to be blue because 
    * Another case: p = i'm a brain in a vat
        - If p were true, I wouldn't believe p
        - If p weren't true, I wouldn't believe p
        - Thus, I'm not sensitive to falsility <--- You cannot Know if your a brain in a vat or not
- What is sensitivity to truth? How does a true belief that is sensitive to truth and falsity amount to knowledge in cases in which a true belief that is sensitive only to falsity does not?
    * Sensitivity to truth means accepting that belief is a subjunctive conditional. So if p weren't true, then you wouldnt believe ~p.
    * Say there is a broken clock in your house that says 3:14. You have no reason to belive its broken and you walk past it and it says 3:14. You have a true belief. Now if you are sensitive to falsilty, if the clock said any other time you would not believe it was that other time. So say the clock said 3:20, if you were sensitive to falsilty, you would not beleive that it is 3:20, however if you weren't sensitivty to falsility, 3:14 or 3:20 either way you would still believe that p. Thus in this case you could only satify the subjective conditional if you were sensitive to falsity.

Zagzebski
---------
- How are Gettier problems produced, according to Zagzebski? What is the formula for producing a Gettier-like problem for any given analysis of knowledge?
    * If knowledge is equal to JTB + X then Gettier problems are inescapable. All one must do it start with a justified belief, make the elemnt of justification stong enough for knowledge, and then make the belief false. What generates the problem for the JTB is accident of bad luck cancelled out by an accident of good luck.
- What is the inescapable dilemma facing analyses of knowledge, according to Zagzebski?
    * No matter how you 

Goldman
-------
- What is Goldman’s account of justification?
    * S is justified in believing that p iff S's belief that p is formed by some reliable cognitive belief-forming process. 
- Explain why Goldman thinks his account of justification is better than some traditional account of justification (say, in terms of indubitability, self-evidence, self-presentation, or incorrigibility). What, in particular, is the main way in which Goldman’s account of justification differs from the aforementioned accounts?
    * Each problematic account for justification can be classified as a good (or reliable) way to hold a belief or a bad (or unreliable) way to hold a belief. For example, while certain truths may seem self-evident such as stating 2+2=4, there are many beliefs that could be held that are self-evident but in no case knowledge. Consider a religious fanatic that believes that God exist simply because he knows it to be the case. God must exist. It is self-evident but in no way justified. (and there in lies the power of reliablism justification)
- Why is Goldman’s account of justification an externalist account of justification?!

Feldman and Conee
-----------------
- According to evidentialism, what is justification?
    * You ought to believe p iff belief p fits your evidence. Your evidence is what determines wether your true beliefs are justified or not.
- Objectors to evidentialism complain that evidentialism requires, or obligates, subjects to believe things that they might not be able to believe. Explain a specific version of this objection to evedentialism and how Feldman and Conee reply to this objection.
- Objectors to evidentialism claim that someone might be justified in believing that p even if their evidence doesn’t fit believing the p, because it is morally wrong to not believe that p. Give an example of such a case and explain why do Conee and Feldman claim this objection fails?
    * A scientist may be sick and may have evidence that 
- Objectors to evidentialism claim that someone might be justified in believing that p even if their evidence doesn’t fit believing the p, because it is prudent to believe that p. Give an example of such a case and explain why do Conee and Feldman claim this objection fails?
    * One example is that of a woman who has all of the proper evidence to epistemically justify that her husband is cheating on her. Based on prudential grounds, she choses not to accept the belief that her husband is cheating on her, but rather just believe that their marraige is fine. In this case Feldman and Conee would say that she may have accepted this belief on prudential obligations, her belief itself would be unjustified epistemically. While her belief is unjustified epistemically, this does not mean that beleving it would do no epistemic good. It could be the case that she goes on to form many other epistemic beliefs that were only enabled by her acting out of prudential obligation. Prudential obligation need not stand contrary to epistemic good. 
- What is the difference, according to Feldman and Conee, between the justification of a belief and the well-foundedness of a belief?
- Feldman and Conee argue against reliabilism by claiming that the reliabilist cannot explain why a clairvoyant is not justified in their beliefs (assuming they aren’t) formed on the basis of their clairvoyance, but we are justified in believing our beliefs based on perception.
    * How is this an objection to reliabilism?
        - Reliablism can be seen as an approximation of well-foundedness. In reliablism and wel-foundedness, the belief must actally be held in order to be favorably evaluated. However, where reliablism diverges from WF is the way in which the belief must be "grounded". In different accounts of reliablism, the way in which the belief is grounded varies. In Well-Foundedness, the way in which the belief is grounded is based on fitting evidence. Thus, one account of reliablism (reliablism in such that the reliable process is that the vidence is fitting) could be seen as equivilant well-foundedness. However, the other account of reliablism which try and pick apart which processes are reliable are falliable in their divergence of what is a "reliable" process. THe processes involved in reliablism can be seen as a sequence of particular casual events which produce differing degrees of reliablity. These casual events which can be reliable or not vary greatly from one version of reliablism to the next. This is the problem with reliablism... 
        - The vagueness of reliablism limits its ability as a theory. Further, it is unclear what the reliablists want out of an account of reliablism. 
    * **How does evidentialism explain the justification of our beliefs based on perception according to Feldman and Conee?**
        - Perception is the only way in which we collect evidence. Thus, perceptions are the root of all of our beliefs. One important part of evidentialism that Feldman and Conee illustrate is that not only are beliefs that are voluntarily cognized justified in the scope of evidentialism, but evidentialism encompass beliefs based on evidence that are formed involuntarily as well. Such, consider when you walk into a room and you spontatnously and involuntarily notice that the lights are on. Intuitivily, evidentialism says you would be justified in your belief that the lights are on. A belief does not have to be voluntary to be justified. On the contrary, a belief that is voluntary is not necessarily justified. A paranoid man may believe on the basis of little to no evidence that he is being followed, however this is not a justified belief. 
    * **Why, according to evidentialism, is a clairvoyant not justified in their clairvoyant beliefs?**
        - The evidentialist would say that the clairvoaynt is not justified because unlike other sorts of evidence, evidence from the clairvoyant's extra sensory ability is not accompanied by testomonial evidence. When a child sees a book and proclaims, I see a book! That claim is accompanied not only by the actual visual evidence of seeing the book but also by testomonial evidence by trusted sources (parents). Over years when the child uses their senses to proclaim evidence about the world they intake through their vision, it is accompanied many times with testomonial evidence. The clairvoyant on the other hand has no testimonial evidence for his extra-sensory claricoyancy.
