- GD Foundations for Internalism
    * Independent motivations for internalism
    * OBjections + Replies to and from internalism

- Goldman's Critism of Internalism
    * First Step:
        - Accept GD Conception of Justification:
            * Theory of Justification should tell us how to dconduct ourselves intellectually by telling us what our intellectual duties/responitites/obligations are
            * Components:
                - Guidance
                    * Theory of justifaction should help guide inquiry/intellectual conduct
                - Deontological
                    * Theory of justification should articulate intellectual responosibilites/duties/obligations
    * Step Two:
        - Knowledge Contstraint on Justifiers
        - GD -> KJ
        - Whether some **justifiers** obtain should be knowable by the subject
            * (Justifiers: State of affairs that determines (at least in part) wheter a belief is justified)
        - If we have some duty based on the GD Concept of Just. then we need it to be the case that we should figure out what our duties are...
    * Step Three
        - GD -> KJ ----?---> Internalism
        - Facts about our own mind are knowable, specially accessible
        - If we make justifiers things that are states of our own mind, inernalism is good way
        - Justifiers are all internal/intrinsic to the subject's mind
    
    * Goldman's point in his article is that GD->KJ is well justified, however it doesn't have to be internalism
        - Internalism doesn't follow from the guidance deontological conception
        - 1. As long as its knowable in someway, doesn't have to be in own mind
            * Don't have to necessarily know own mind
            * There are some things we can know (or accuratly figure out) about the world beyond our mind
            * If the only thing we can know is things about our own mind, then internalism would follow
            * As long as domain of things knowable is not 
        - 2. If you add some condition (say by reflecting on there consious state, memories, etc)
            * None 

Feldman and Connee
==================
- Justification is internal to one's own mind
- Difference in justification can be traced/motivated by a difference in mental states
- Two Theses: Core principles of Internalism 
    * Supervenience: 
        - S: The jsutifatory status of a person's doxastic attitudes strongly supervenes on the person's occurent and dispositional mental states, events, and conditions
        - The difference can be traced to a difference in the two peoples mental states
    * M: If any two possible individuals are exactly alike mentaly then they are exactly alike justificationally.. e.g the same beliefs are justified for them to the same extent
        - Mentalism
- 5 Cases
    * Bob and Ray
        - Bob and Ray believe its hot out, in AC lobby, read about heat
        - Bob goes outside and feels the heat, difference in mental state accounts for difference in justificaiton
    * Bird Wathcers
        - Expert bird watcher and ameter go out to watch
        - Expert knows the bird is a woodpecker
        - Expert has justified belief, ameter doesn't
    * Logic TA
        - Logic TA can know which truths follow, student doesn't
    * Gettier Case
        - Nogot has the ford
        - Your justified in believing nogot has the ford
        - Ngot is faking it.
        - DIff in justificationary status <--> conitive internal change
    * Brain in a VAT
        - 1st case: Faint memory of what had for breakfast... had oatmeal for breakfast
        - 2nd case: Vivid memory what had for breakfastll;
        - Phenomenal quality of memory different, justificationary status is different
- These kind of 5 cases is the same kind of setup goldman used for reliablism/externalism

- Critism/Objections to Internalism
    * Is there a mental state to justify?
        - Simple mathematical beliefs.
        - What justifies 2+3=5
        - Impulsionary Evidence
    * Stored Beliefs
        - Moms birthday
        - Don't know why you believe it.
        - What evidence is there to justify the belief
        - One kind of internalism is that concious state are only possible justifiers
        - Concious States -> Nothing consous to justify LOTS of justified beliefs.
            * Consequence: Large scale skepticism
                - We loose lots of beliefs
