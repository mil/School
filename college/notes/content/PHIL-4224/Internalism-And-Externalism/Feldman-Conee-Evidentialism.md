- Reliablism: A form of externalism
    * Externalist: Justicication depends on some facts not intrinsic to your mind.
        - Reliable = Mind + World..
            * Wheter a mechanism is reliable depends on this world... a processes reliability is tied to the unique world it inhabits
            * Reliablity is tied to the world
            * Example: Inductive Inference (reliable in our world, but may not be in other worlds)
                - Bob,   an old man and a philosopher
                - Allen, an old man and a philosopher
                - Tom,   an old man and a philosopher
                - Inductive Generalization: 
                    * All old men are philosophers

- S's beleif that p is justified if  S's belief that p is formed by:
    * An unconditionally reliable process
        - ( Belief independent belief forming process)
        - Reliable (scope of evaluation) process (how general/abstract)
    * A Conitionally Reliable Process
        - (All inputs are justified)
        - (Belief dependent process)
- Tack on quialifier of:
    * No other process **available** to S which would've resulted in S not believing p
        - Need to specify avaliablity
- Three crucial:
    * Available
    * Reliablity
    * Process

Feldman and Conee - Evidentialism
=================================
- Feldman assumes that evidentialism is a good basic starting point
    * Rather than shaping prior theories (like reliablism)
- Evidentialist Belief (EB)
    * S's believe that p is justified if believing that p fits S's evidence.
    * Internalist thesis: What evidence you have is just an intrinsic feature of your mind
- Objections to Evidentialism
    * Justification -> Ought -> Can
        - Ev says youa re/not justified in believing p
        - BUT its not possi ble for you to believe that p (or not)
        - No Voluntary Control
            * You don't choose what to believe
            * paranoid person: evidentialism 
        - Evidentialism imposes dmenads that go beyond *doxastic possibility*
            * Either for reason of doaxastic involuntarism or cognitive limitations
            * Evidentialist Standards =>  ought/not/believe -> can/not believe
        - Cognitive Limitation
            * Infinitly many beliefs, justified in beliving all those propositions
            * R: If its raining today, M: the sky is green
                - Disjunct:  RvM, ~R :. M
            * Response: we have high standards for how we ought to conduct ourselves epistemically
                - Ought to can only implies to moral domain
    * You ought to believe p iff belief p fits your evidence
        - Evidentialism implies a wrong account of our doxastic obligations
        - Alternative: You ought to blieve all and only truths
        - CJ: S's belief that p is justified iff S considers p and believing that p woudl result from S trying to believe that p iff pjj
            * What is **trying to** believe?
                - Were back to evidentialism
        - Evidentialist goes wrong with obligation: 
            * Justification -> Obligation
            * ~Obligation.... ~Justification
    * Not Justified BUT Belief fits the Evidence
        - You ought to responsibly pursue/collect evidence
        - Physicist headstrong who ignores all advice....
            * He has evidence but has not collected all evidence
    * Beliveing that p is morally wrong BUT it fits your evidence
        - I see evidence that secrartary of state is a common spy
        - If I release this info/knowledge, morally bad consequences ensue
        - Wife has evidence that husband is cheating, but itd be better if the wife ought not believe this 
- Evidentialism + Well Foundedness
    * WF: S's belief that p is wellfounded iff:
        1. S's belief is justified
        2. Sbelieve p on te basis of some evidence e,, and has no more inclusive body of evidence on which p is not justified

Clairvoyant
===========
- Person can come to know thing magically
    * Has reliable beliefs
    * Ex. Know location of president
    * Two Kinds of Cases
        - Vision
        - No "Vision"
    * A Sixth Sense
        - They are exactly as justified with clarvoyant beliefs as we are with our senses
    * Past experience of reliability/verdicality
