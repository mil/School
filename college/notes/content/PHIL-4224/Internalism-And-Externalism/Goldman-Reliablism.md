- Justification Account: S has a **Justified Belief** iff ........ 
- Conditions:
  * Only Non-Epistemic Terms
    - Ex: Belief, Causes, Necesitate, Implies, Is True, Is Probable
    - Versus Epistemic Terms Ex: Justified, Warant, Good Grounds
- Failures -> Diagnose common features of those failures
  * Our **proper account** should remedy those failures

      * Indubitable
        - Psychological
          * Counter-example able
        - Epistemlogical
          * No grounds to doubt
    - S has a JB that p iff p is self evident
      * Epistomological
        - Impossible to understand without believing it
          * Impossible for humanns
            - Ex: Kantian, everything has a cause
          * Impossible for anyone/antyhing
    - S has JB that p iff p is self intimating
