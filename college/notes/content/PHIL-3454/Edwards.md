    * 1) Against(5):
        - Why think the unmoved mover has divine attributes?
        - (12) If there is no first cause in the series
            * Then no member of the series will be caused to exist
    * 2) Against (12): Denying the existence of some cause vs. denying that there is a first cuase
    * 3) Does not show a **single** first cause
    * 4) Does not show that the first cause **exists now**
        - Reply: Distinguish causes in fieri (brings x into existence causes in esse
            * (sustains the existsnce of x)

Edwards' Counter-Replies
========================
- If (1) concerns causes *in esse*, then it is not as *prima facie* plausible.
    * "In nature, each thing has cause in esse."
- The inifinte series of cuases *in esse* is still tenable for the same reason as before
- Unlike a finite series, each cause *in esse* of an infinite series would itself have a cause *in esse*
    * Reply:
        - Even if there is an infinite series of causes (or either type), the existence of the series 
        - If you have an infinite series: a -> b -> c -> d
        - This infinite series itself must have a sustaining cause
