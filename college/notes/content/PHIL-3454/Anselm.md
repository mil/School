The Ontological Argument
========================

Anslem's Version
-----------------
- **Structure**:
    1. The **Greatest Conceivable Being** [GCB] exist at least in the mind
    2. It is greater for the GCB to **exist in the mind and in reality** than to exist in the mind alone
    3. So, the GCB must **exist in reality**. [From (1), (2)]
    4. **God = GCB**
    5. So, God exists. [From (3), (4)]
- **Reply 1**:
    * Argument
        - If x exists, then it is greater *in power* than an x that does not exist. It has:
            * the power of existing in reality
            * the power to cause things in reality
    * Counter Reply:
        - But what about the power of non-existence or the fact that ideas in the mind cause actions?
        - Versus -- *in the skull*
    * Ideas in reality as brain states...
        - Pegasus is *in the mind...*
        - Pegasus doesn't cause things in reality
- **Reply 2**:
    * It is better for x to exist than to not exist
    * If x is perfect
    * (By better, perfect is meant)
- **Gaunilo's Objection**:
    * Argument:
        - You can run the argument on the:
            * "Greatest Conceivable Island"
    * Reply:
        - GCB = has all perfections, so it's the only case where you can deduce existence crom the idea
    * Counter:
        - You can still imagine a perfect island with the perfection of existence.
        - But that doesn't mean it exists
- **Kant's Objection**
    * Argument:
        - Existence is not a Predicate [Reply: *ad hoc?*]
        - When Anslem describes the GCB, it is implied that the GCB exists
            * You wouldn't talk about it if it didn't exist
    * Argument 2:
        - Definitions are "iffy":
            * 'existicorn" = df a unicorn that exists
            * 'existicorns exist'
            * x is an existicorn if, and only if, x is a unicorn and x exists
        - (Partial Def): 'GCB' refers to x only if x exists.
            * 'GCB exists'
            * x is a GCB only if x exists
            * 'x exists if x is a GCB
            * *Open Question*: Is there any such x?

Version 2 -- Plantinga
-----------------------
1. 'GCB' referes to something that *necessarily* exists,
    - i.e. : exists in *every* possible world
2. The GCB is at least *possi ble*
    - i.e.: there is at least on epossibel world with a GCB
