        There I was. "3 c-notes is the bet", Shank said to me. My chipstack had been down all night and Shank suggesting a $300 bet when I only had $120 to my name was pretty fucking insulting. But, this night was going to be different. This night had to be different. Also, I had faith in the jacks. In a way, I was a jack. Plus, this was probably the best shot I would get.  This night <i>had</i> different. I responded back to the Shanker, "I'm all in". I felt it and when you feel it it can't be unfelt. Once I called, I watched as Shank flipped over his K-9. K-9 versus Jacks. I was in the green. The flop came: &diams;Q &spades;K &clubs;10. Fuck. He'd paired up on his kings and only an ace could save me. The turn came out &diams;K. I was in an even worse situation now - he'd hit trips. Shank said "Nice playing with you, nice taking your money". The river came out &spades;Ace. And there it was, this game of skill had been reduced down to chance and that chance had done me right. I had been blessed, by the gods. When such improbable odds hit, there can be no other explanation. I had been chosen. I was the one. Nothing except for my awesomeness mattered at that moment.

        I cashed out of Jeff's game with $240 and hopped in my car.  Walking in the front door I heard my wife scream to me "Fryodor, I hope you weren't at Jeff's". I responded "Ofcourse not baby, you know i honor the pact". My wife was taking my no-gambling pact somewhat seriously and I'm not entirely sure she trusted me. I could never quite understand her and to be honest I'm not sure if she understood me, but I was the one that should have been understandable. Why did she care so much what I chose to do? My gambling was healthy. I acted on rationalition self interest. It wasn't a problem with me, it was a problem with her. And it went on and off, I wasn't always gambling it was just sometimes I wanted to gamble and I was smart about it. God damn it, I was justified, let no one tell me otherwise.

        I rolled out of my bed at about 4AM. There was this blaring funk beat playing within my mind and I couldn't seem to recolect the pause button. Bow bonan boo, it went over and over. With this incessive beat stuck in my head, I couldn't fall back to sleep. Seeing as how I was already awake and I had gotten a reasonable number of hours of sleep (~ 5), I figured I might as well kick it awake. Tuesday was bad. I didn't take all the risks I could take. I didn't earn enough, I just wasn't at the top of my game. So at that though, I turned on the computer and logged onto PokerStars. I quickly joined cash games to get myself awake. I cranked up my sound system and then proceeded over to the kitchen. Looking within my fridge, I saw salvation. Yes, thank the lord I had bagel bites! If there was one thing that made my life good at that momemnt, it was bagel bites. I heated up the toaster and I was there, in bagel bite heaven. Eating my bagel bites I headed back to PokerStar's cash games -- I quickly dropped a half a g to enter into three cash games. I entered two $2/4 (blinds) game buying in with $200 each, a $1/2 game I was fucking around with for $100. The hours swept on by as I sat affixated to my computer screen. I felt like I could figure out the game. I would always either have this feeling or not on hands. I didn't play on statistics but the reactions of my opponent. I just knew the gamble of poker at that moment -- I wouldn't think, rationalize, I just knew the gamble of poker. I always knew the right amount to bet. This time was no different, I won up to $1200 that morning. Eventually the morning had to end as I heard a ringing, beep beep beep and about a half hour later my wife stumbled out of the bedroom to discover me gambling, engulfed in bliss. She asked me, "Are you going to work Fry?". Ofcourse I was goddamit.

      <p> My gambling could be explained in terms of feeding quick rushes while the amount of money I had went up. I act on value. Gambling is a game of chance, is not life in itself a game of chance. In life you gamble with consequences, every action you take has a consequence which can be assigned a positive or negative value in terms of your happiness. Similarly with gambling every action has a consequence some beneficial others not so. The short-term is shit -- real gamblers are in it for the long term and that's where you see actual true gain.

      <p>This is not my problem. Or is it my problem. Just because I loosea little bit in one night does not mean that my life is over. No, I am the best. My problems will resolve. My gambling is the master-plan. I can win so much money. Imagine taking my 50 figures and doubling it. And then doubling it again. This is the kind of thing that can be done. People do this all the time. I'll just be one of those people. I'll continually double my money. I will have so many bills I will be able to feed the poor. I will be able to fund my future children's college education. I will have had purpose, I will be him.

        I need to find help. These episodes of gambling do not do me good. I believe in the full-heartedly with all my faith, devotion, and soul when I am gambling. But is this gambling good for me. It seems as if everything is down for me. Somebody stabbed me in the soul and ripped out what remained. A pathetic gambling scum of this universe. His name Frydor. Also why the fuck am I named Fydor. Its as if my parents had been fans of Dykofsky. Oh yeah thats right I'll never fucking know because I was put up for adoption. This sickens me. Who am I anyway? Is this me? Gambling, bagel bites, and driving to a parklot to not go to work?

        But this is me, I am Frydor. But who is that? Frydor, mydor, what am I? Who am I? Cheap thrills, gambling, and debounchery.
