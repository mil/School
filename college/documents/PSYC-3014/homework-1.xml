        There I was. "3 c-notes is the bet", Shank said to me. My chipstack had been down all night and Shank was suggesting a $300 bet when I only had $120 to my name. That was pretty damn insulting. But, this night was going to be different. This night had to be different. Also, I had faith in the jacks. Plus, this was probably the best shot I would get.  This night <i>had</i> different. I responded back to the Shanker, "I'm all in". I felt it and when you feel it it can't be unfelt. Once I called, I watched as Shank flipped over his K-9. K-9 versus my jacks. I was in the green. The flop came: &diams;Q &spades;K &clubs;10. Fuck. He'd paired up on his kings and only an ace could save me. The turn came out &diams;K. I was in an even worse situation now - he'd hit trips. Shank said "Nice playing with you, nice taking your money". The river came out &spades;A. And there it was, this game of skill had been reduced down to chance and that chance had done me right. I had been blessed, by the gods. When such improbable odds hit, there can be no other explanation. I had been chosen. I was the one. Nothing except for my awesomeness mattered at that moment.

        I cashed out of Jeff's game with $240 and hopped in my car.  Walking in the front door I heard my wife scream to me "Fyodor, I hope you weren't at Jeff's". I responded "Ofcourse not baby, you know i honor the pact". My wife was taking my no-gambling pact somewhat seriously and I'm not entirely sure she trusted me. I could never quite understand her and to be honest I'm not sure if she understood me, but I was the one that should have been understandable. Why did she care so much what I chose to do? My gambling was healthy. I acted on rational self interest. It wasn't a problem with me, it was a problem with her. Also, I don't keep track but I was pretty sure that I was up.Also gambling is on and off or me. I'm not always gambling it was just sometimes I wanted to gamble. And I was good at it. God damn it, I was justified, let no one tell me otherwise.

        I rolled out of my bed at about 4AM. There was this blaring funk beat playing within my mind and I couldn't seem to recolect the pause button. Bow bonan boo, it went over and over. With this incessive beat stuck in my head, I couldn't fall back to sleep. Seeing as how I was already awake and I had gotten a reasonable number of hours of sleep (~ 5), I figured I might as well kick it awake. Sunday was bad. I didn't take all the risks I could have taken. I didn't earn enough, I just wasn't at the top of my game. So at that thought, I turned on the computer and logged onto PokerStars. I quickly joined cash games to get myself awake. I cranked up my sound system and then proceeded over to the kitchen. Looking within my fridge, I saw salvation. Yes, thank the lord I had bagel bites! If there was one thing that made my life good at that momemnt, it was bagel bites. I heated up the toaster and I was there, in bagel bite heaven. 
      </p>

      <p>
        Eating my bagel bites I headed back to PokerStar's cash games -- I quickly dropped a half a g to enter into three cash games. I entered two $2/4 (blinds) game buying in with $200 each, a $1/2 game I was playing with for $100. The hours swept on by as I sat affixated to my computer screen. I felt like I could figure out the game. I would always either have this feeling or not on hands. I didn't play on statistics but the reactions of my opponent. I just knew the gamble of poker at that moment -- I wouldn't think, rationalize, I just knew the gamble of poker. I always knew the right amount to bet. This time was no different, I won $1200 that morning. Eventually the morning had to end as I heard a ringing, beep beep beep and about a half hour later my wife stumbled out of the bedroom to discover me gambling, engulfed in bliss. She asked me, "Are you going to work Fy?". Ofcourse I was goddamit.

      <p> Work is incredibly annoying but I guess kids have to get their history education some how. Yes American history is important, but so is being mature. Kids never mature fast enough though. I do have to admit its funny and it makes me laugh when I see kids gambling though. Brackets, sports, and just card betting seems to have its way in the high school social culture just as much as its influence in general. That can be the only thing to cheer me up here at school.
      </p>
      <p>
        In a few years I'll have tenure and I'll be secure. I will never have to think about these kids. I'll just do what I want. I'll not have to care. I'll never get fired. Yes, that'll be the day. Kids will naturally after years come to respect me.My reputation will be solid. Everybody in the town will know my name. Kids will only treat me with the utmost respect and will be proud to be students. Everyone will jive.
      </p>
      <p>
        But, most of the times when I hear these students voices they've began to sound like shrills in my ears. It's like someone is always pushing the chalk against the chalkboard in my mind. There is always that feeling I get in my soul when I hear that shrilly sound even when there is no shrilly sound. Nobody writes on the chalkboard in my classroom. I just use a projector but I occasionally am caught in a room when someone is using the chalkboard in such way. AH, it drives me insane. It makes me incredibly angry. I would like to just take the kid and throw the chalk at him. Gahnn. Blah! But I know I'll get through this day. I only have a few more hours to go. I'm on lunchbreak now so I'm just about half way through. Thank god. I need to get out of here. I need to escape. I guess the time will pass and I will be free eventually. I think I may have enough time left in my lunch break to drive to Starbucks, pull my laptop out, and play a few games on PokerStars. I'll get some coffee going, maybe throw in a shot of espresso or two. I think I may still have some ritalin in my car. Yeah I'll win a little poker, get up, come back and teach my afternoon class. It sounds like a grand plan. It'll be great.

        Ahhhh, the Taj. Thank god I get these days from time to time. I need to relax, fuck my normal life. When I'm away at the Taj its all different. It's relaxation, its bliss, its straight clear freedom. Jb was visiting town and we had a tradition of hitting up the Taj Mahal casino. I brought my lucky quarter with me and I was set. After getting off of work, we headed down. I hit the cash machine and got 2000 bills. Walking into the casino lobby, my eyes lit up. This was it. This was the place. Thank you lord. Me and Jb hit the craps tables first. I totally had a system for craps. I was best. In gambling as long as you can get around break even return you are fine. If your netting 53% sometimes its just about the same as netting 48% at othertimes. You could be at 27% and gambling your lives savings beacuse later on you'll be at 73% at other times in the highlights of your gambling.
      </p>
      <p>
        Craps is a probablistic theory game. I'm not positive what my %loss at craps was but it seemed like I was loosing a lot. I needed to win, gambling is fun but gambling and winning is even more fun. I hit up the poker tables. I knew there was money for me there.  I spent several hours at the poker table. There was this foreign couple there loading rebuy through rebuy. They were just shoveling their money away. It was despicable. I said to them, "That is not how you gamble". They replied back to me, "I never, how dare you sir". The man came over acting like he was ready to throw a punch but then decided to back down after his wife was crying not to hit me. They seriously needed to get their shit together. That couple was really getting on my nerve.
      </p>
      <p>
        Anyway after I left the poker table I met back up with my buddy Jb. We started prop betting. We'd bet on anything: the gender of the next person to sit down at a particular slot machine, the drink a particular person would order at the bar, or even just repetivie coinflips. Jb fueled my gambling urge to the max. Damn it was bad having him around. He seemed to be just an agent to my gambling impluse. I gambled all night long with Jb on prop bets. And then it was all gone....

        I need to find help. These episodes of gambling do not do me good. I believe in myself with the full-heartedness of faith, devotion, and soul but I only have this feeling when I am gambling. Is this gambling good for me. It seems as if everything is down for me. Somebody stabbed me in the soul and ripped out what remained, just delerious faith in gambling. A pathetic gambling scum of this universe. Named, Fyodor. I fucking hate this name. My parents were probably some insane Dostoyevsky freaks. Oh yeah thats right I'll never fucking know because I was put up for adoption. This sickens me. Who am I anyway? Is this me? This is me - I am Fyodor. But who is that? Cheap thrills gambling, god damn it. I'm masking something but I don't know what it is. Gambling is my way, its my way to be happy. When I'm gambling I'm happy and when I'm not gambling, I'm not happy, it is as simple as that. But I need to cash out. Its been too much. I'm out of the game. I must stop. No, if I stopped my life, my character, who I am would be different. That is a major life decision -- I wish not to make that decision at this point. Its 2AM into the next dup ay and I cannot find the power to get myself to sleep. I seem to be gambling and loosing a lot and only winning a little. I just need to make this winning a lot and losing a lot. I need that balance. I need to then advance from there.  I know I would be able to advance, my wife would love me. I would have won enough money we would never had to think about money again. I'd buy it all. A house, a boat. I would go door to door with a stack of one hundred dollar bills just giving them as handout. I could spread peace, love, and rest in this world. I just need to take that first step. I have to get even. 
        
      </p>
      <p>
        My problems will resolve. My gambling is the master-plan. I can win so much money. Imagine taking my life savings and doubling it. And then doubling it again. This is the kind of thing that can be done. People do this all the time. I'll just be one of those people. I'll continually double my money. I will have so many bills I will be able to feed the poor. I will be able to fund my future children's college education. I will have had purpose, I will be that guy. I will be him.
