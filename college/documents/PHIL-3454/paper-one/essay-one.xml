    <div id="title">A Temporal Order to the Universe Independent of Man?</div>
    <div class="response">
      <p>
        William Paley outlines a version of the teleological argument which he supports by comparing the design of human artifacts to the design of the universe. Stumbling upon a watch, or another human artifact, one can observe a unique design. A watch is composed of numerous gears, intricite parts, and it is aligned in just the right order. Human artifacts, like the watch, which exhibit design are due to a human designer. The universe is similar to the watch and other human artifacts in that it exhibits an unique design. Thus, similar to the watch having designer, the universe must have a designer. Further, the designer of an universe would require god-like powers and therefore more likely than not God exists. Hume raises objections to the teleological argument by claiming: there is no inherent design to the universe, we are not justified in stating that the universe has design, and further even if the universe had design we could not say it was one deity reponsible for said design. Swinburne objects to Hume by re-emphasizing the existence of an underlying temporal order in the universe supporting that there must be an orderer. Preceeding I will give a brief account of Hume's objections to the teleological argument, give an account of Swinburne's responses to Hume's objections, and further defend Hume's position that we are not justified in claiming whether the universe exhibits design by showing humans falliability in such matter.

        Hume's first objection to the teleological argument is that the analogy between the watch and the universe is weak. While a watch exhibits order in a confined, small, and understandable man-made artifact, nature itself is infinitly larger and diverse in size. Each facet of the universe is unique and uncomparable in its own right. Although we may notice some design and consistancy within what we have discovered about the universe in so far, it is a fallacy of hasty generalization to imply that what we have observed about the design of the nature is generizable.  Additionally, regardless of wheter the universe has design or not we would not be justified in such claim. Just as a peasent cannot understand a complex literary poem, we are not in a position to judge and evaluate the universe as being a great and infalliable design with order. We know no other universes so by just looking upon our own universe we cannot objectivly state if our universe contains any underlying faults, patchwork, or is even design at all. Contrarily, even if there were a design to the universe, we could not assume the design to be the work of a single deity. Just as a house built by numerous carpenters will show the differeing handywork of each, it could be possible that our universe is the work of multiple dieties. Further, the designers of our artifacts are men who are by no means perfect beings. Similarly, the dieties that constructed our universe could be supposed to have similar impefections as man. In fact, why not assume that the dieteies like us have human figures similar to Greek gods and capable of the creation of nature?

        Swinburn rebuts Hume's objections by emphasizing the notion of regularities of succession within the universe. While Hume wants to say that the universe has no underlying uniform design, Swinburne claims that there is a striking order and consistent design to the universe. Much of the universe's matter can be explained in basic formulas provided by physics. Swinburne presents that what we have discovered about the universe illustrates a clear temporal order. Further, even if the laws science has derived of the order are faulty and don't properly describe the unvierse, <i>the uniformity of nature exists independent of humans</i>. Given such uniformity, the analogy of human design to the universe design remains sound. Additionally, Swinburn critisizes Hume's notion that the design of the universe could be due to multiple deities by ahering to the Cosmological argument. Hume claims that we cannot know about the begining of the universe so it just as possible to imagine a team of deities that constructed the universe as opposed to a single deity. Swinburne replies noting that the first-cause of the universe is something we are unable to speculate on. Further, it is anthethetical to the practice of philosophy to introduce additional complication where there need not be. Taking into account the inhernet uniform temporal order of the universe, it is more likely there is one deity as opposed to multiple. If the universe was the conjoined work of a team of designers, we would find disorder in the universe's design rather than conformity.

        Swinburne proceeds in his argument to show the existence of God is more likely than not by building on his notion of regularities of succession. His argument (excluding his appeal to buety which is beyond the scope of Hume's objections) proceeds as follows:
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li>There exists a complex physical universe.</li>
        <li>There is a underlying uniformity in the universe which suggests a regularity in succession indepedent of humans. (Temporal Order)</li>
        <li>If God were to exist and cause (1), he would have good reason for (2) as opposed to creating a chaotic universe.</li>
        <li>P(1 &amp; 2 &amp; 3) > P(1 &amp; 2)</li>
        <li>Therefore: God more likely than not exists<span class="small">(From 4)</span></li>
      </ol>

      <p>
        The problem with Swinburne's argument is that (2) is an incredibly weak premise. Why are we justified in claiming that there is an temporal order to the universe? A large part of Swinburne's argument rest on this notion, but he never asserts why we are entitled to this justification. Swinburne puts it as, "there has been and will continued to be in nature an order, recognizable and describable by men certaintly, but one which exisats independent of men". However, our observation of "design" in nature not proper justification for objectivly stating that there is inherint design in nature independent of man's observations.
      </p>
        
        <p>
          One reason why we are unjustified in such inference is that our minds naturally impose order where there is none. This can be seen in many psychological phenonemna including a principle known as "chunking". Chunking shows that if were are given a string of sequential bits of information you store information in ordered "chunks". As such, given the phone number 8279378173, a human will store the number as: 827 - 937 - 8173. Similarly to chunking, Gestalt pyschology demonstrates that the mind attempts to understand stimuli in groups. When you look at a collection of dots you often see rows, colums, and a grid rather than just a collection of dots. The point is, the human mind is falliable when it comes to understanding order because it naturally imposes order on its own. Regardless of if the universe exhibits unique design (temporal order), our minds will percieve there to be order in either case. Assume p to be the proposition "there is order in the universe" and q the proposition <i>we believe</i> that p. Humans will hold q from p &rarr; q just as likely as they will hold q from ~p &rarr; q.
      </p>

      <p>
        The point is that humans are in no position to objectivly justify wether the universe exhibits unique design. Theories to describe nature come and go. Some disprove vast quantities of theories, some build atop our existing theories, and others disprove all other theories. Man has always seeked to describe theories showing pattern and order in the universe, but has an incredibly diffucult time doing so sucessfully. Swinburne himself notes the example of the aether. In the nineteenth century scientists created a theory centered around a medium called aether to ascribe reflection and refraction of light in a similar manner to sound. Later in history this theory was proven falacious and replaced.  Swinburne recognizes that men cannot properly describe the order of the universe, yet somehow he induces that, regardless of the fact that man cannot describe the universe, either way, there is some order or design to the universe. This is unsound. The only evidence Swinburne gives supporting the claim that the universe has design independent of man is that over the years man has attempted to describe a design of the universe. This is insufficient evidence.

        Suppose an abstract artist gathers a number of colored paints and proceeds to throw the paints onto a blank canvas in seemingly no order. Then, the artist has several art critics describe the order and design of the painting. The critics responses vary: one says it looks like a house, another says its a coffee bean (because this critic knows that the artist loves coffee), another says it resmbles his wife, and the last says that no definitive statement can be made about the painting. The painting in this example is the universe and the various responses of the critics are our interpretations of the "design" of the universe. There can be any number of ways in which the "design" of the universe can be described. Some may seem more accurate than others but the only reasonable deduction which can be concluded is in line with the last critic's view. The artist had no intention when splattering the paint on the canvas. However, this analogy is a bit off with the universe's creation because the critics may know the character of the artist. For the analogy to be a true fit, imagine instead of the artist bringing the critics in, the critics knew nothing of the artist's character and instead just randomly stumbled upon the painting. What can the critics say now about the painting's design? In the first case, it is possible that the critics maybe knew the character of the artist and could deduce what design the artist was trying to achieve was (as was the case with one critic noting a coffee bean). However, in the latter example, not even that much could be said. Nothing is known about the artist and thus it is impossible to make any definitive or objective statements about the design of the painting. Similarly, nothing is known about the designer of the universe so we are not justified in claiming that the universe itself even has design. All we are justified in is interpretation.
      </p>

        Humans can choose to interpret all kinds of order and design within the universe. However, just because we can ascribe design and order to our interpretations does not mean such order exists. Adhering to an agnostic standpoint, we are simply not in a position to judge wheter or not the universe exhibits order or design. Thus (2) from Swinburne's argument is an unsound premise, rendering Swinburne's objections to Hume and further argument for a designer's existence, or mere probable existence, faulty.  As Hume himself presented this issue through the voice of Philo: "that order, arrangment, or the adjustment of final causes, is not of itself any proof of design, but only so far as it has been experienced".
