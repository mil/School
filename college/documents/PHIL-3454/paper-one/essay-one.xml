        Intro Paragraph
      </p>

      <p>
        In <i>The Watch and the Watchmaker</i>, William Paley outlines a simple version of the Teleological argument centered around using the analogy of designed human artifacts having a designer to the universe having a designer to imply God's existence is probable. Stumbling upon a watch, or another human artifact from an unkown source, one can observe a unique design exhibited. A watch is composed of numerous gears, intricite parts, and it is aligned in just the right order. Human artifacts, like the watch, which exhibit design are due to an intelligent human designer. The universe, is similar to the watch and other human artifacts in that it exhibits a unique design. Thus, similar to the watch having a designer, the universe must have a designer. Further the designer of a universe would require god-like abilities and therefore more likely than not God exists.
      </p>

      <p>
        Hume rejects the teological argument, refusing to accept that the universe has a designer or God. Firstly, Hume raises an objection that the analogy between the watch and the universe is weak. While a watch exhibits design and order within a confined small and understadle artifact, nature itself is infinitly larger and diverse in size and design. Nature has an insurmountably large design and each facet of its design is unique and uncomparable in its own right. Although we may notice some design and consistancy within what we have discovered about the universe as so far, it is a fallacy of hasty generalization to imply that what we have observed about the design of the nature as thus far is generizable.  Additionally, Hume posits that for as much order and design we find in nature, there could be disorder which we are not capable of recognizing. Just as a peasent cannot understand a complex literary poem, we are not in a position to judge and evaluate the universe as being a great and infalliable design. We know no other universes so by just looking upon our universe we cannot objectivly state if our universe contains any underlying faults or patch-work in design. (Hume, 78)
      </p>

      <p>
        Additionally, Hume grants that even if there were a unique design to the universe we could not posit that it is the work of just one single deity. Just as a house built by numerous construction workers will show evidence of the differening handiwork and craftsmenship of each, it could be possible that our universe is the work of multiple dieties. While there is some conformity to nature, there is no universal uniformity. Thus we cannot concede that the universe is the work of just a single diety. Further, the designers of our artifacts, men, are mortal, reproduce, and are by no means perfect beings. Similarly, the dieties that constructed our universe we could suppose to have similar impefections as man. In fact, why not assume that the dieteies like us have human figures, and are not just in a way super-humans capable of creation of nature?
      </p>

      <p>
        In <i>The Argument from Design</i>, Swinburn rebuts Hume's objections by emphasizing the notion of regularities of succession within the universe. While Hume wants to say that the universe has no underlying uniform design, Swinburne claims that there is a striking order and consistent design to the universe. Much of the world's phenonememon can be explained in terms of physics, chemistry, and other fields. Such studies can ascribe most phenonmena within the universe in incredibly sucint formuli and logic. Swinburne presents that what we have discovered about the universe illustrates a clear uniformity in nature of the universe.  Further, even if our laws science has derived were to be faulty, the important aspect is that <i>the uniformity of nature exists independent of humans</i>. Everything which humans create, that can be observed within the universe, and that has ever existed exhibits a unique order and design.  No matter our formuli and the way humans choose to interpret and understand the basic structure of the design of the universe, it exists independnet of man.  Given such uniformity, the analogy of human design (such as in the case of the watch) to the universe's design is valid. 
      </p>

      <p>
        Additionally, Swinburn critisizes Hume's notion that the design of the universe could be due to multiple deities by concedeing to the cosmological argument. Hume claims that we cannot know about the begining of the universe so it is equally as possible to posit: a team of deities that constructed the universe versus a single deity. Swinburne replies noting that the origin or the first-cause of the universe is something we are unable to speculate about. Further it is anthethetical to the practice of philosophy to introduce additional complication wehere there need be not. This inhernet uniformity in the regularities of succession within the univeres illustrate a conform work.  If the world were the work of numerous deities, or a team of designers, we would more likely find disorder nature and no conform pattern. Additionally given that there is an underlying order or conformity in nature Swinburne assert that this orderly in nature is either: just design of nature or design of nature created by a God. This design in nature is far to complex to go unexplained. From this Swinburne assert that the probability that this conformity is more likely to occur if God were to exist then not.
      </p>

      <p>
        Swinburne proceeds in his argument to proceed to show the existence of God is more likely than not by building on his notion of regularities of succession. His argument from a generalized view (excluding his appeal to buety which is beyond the scope of Hume's objections) proceeds as follows:
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li>
          There exists a complex physical universe.
        </li>
        <li>
          There is a underlying uniformity in the universe that suggests a regularity in succession indepedent of humans.
        </li>

        <li>
          If God were to exist, he would have 2 good reasons to produce the orderly universe illustrated by (1) as opposed to a chaotic universe:
          <ol>
            <li>
              
            </li>
            <li>
              There must be predictable regularities which creates can utilize to produce beutifal design.
            </li>
          </ol>
        </li>

        <li>
          Thus, P((1 &amp; 2) &amp; 3) > P((1 &amp; 2) &amp; ~4)
        </li>

        <li>
          Thus: Given (5), God more likely than not exists
        </li>

      </ol>


      <p>
        The problem with Swinburne's argument is that (2) is an incredibly weak premise. Why are we justified in claiming that there is an temporal order to the world? A large part of Swinburne's argument is based on this notion that the universe exhibits a temporal order that is inherent in nature. As Swinburne puts it, "there has been and will continued to be in nature an order, recognizable and describable by men certaintly, but one which exisats independent of men". Swinburne views this idea of the uniformity or order within nature as being critical to the teoleological argument. Physics can ascribe patterns, formula, and simple equations to descibe the basics physical matter of the underlying universe.
      </p>

      <p>
        In the study of cognitive psychology, there is a principle known as chunking in which humans naturally see order where there is seemingly none. Chunking shows that if were are given a string of sequential bits of information we will cognitivly process those bits of information in "chunks". As such, when you are given a phone number such as 8279378173, you will naturally store that information in chunks as: 827 - 937 - 8173. Similarly to chunking, Gesalt pyschology demonstrates that the mind attemps to understand stimuli as groups. The point is that the human mind is falliable when it comes to understanding order because it naturally imposes order where there is seemingly none.
      </p>

      <p>
        Just as Swindburne appeals to the Cosmological argument to reduce Hume's notion that there could be multiple deities as opposed to one because we are in no position to judge, I assert that we are in no position to interpret the order of the universe in an objective manner. Theories to describe nature come and go, some disprove a vast quantitiy of others, some build atop our existing knowledge. Man has always seeked to ascribe pattern and order in the universe, but has an incredibly diffucult time doing so. Swinburne himself notes, in the nineteenth century scientists a theory centered around a medium called aether to ascribe reflection and refraction of light similar to sound. Since this theory has been proven falacious and replaced.
      </p>

      <p>
        The patterns exhibited in the unvierse and not able to be accuratly described by men. Swinburne recognizes this fully, yet he asserts that, regardless, there is some order in the design of the universe. Suppose an action-painting abstract artist gathers a number of different colors of paint and proceeds to throw the paint onto a blank canvas in no seeming order. Then the artist has a number of art critics describe to what the painting is of. The critics responses vary: one says it looks like a duck, another says it's a house, another says it resmbles his wife, and a last says that no definitive statement could be made about the painting because clearly the artist had no intention when splattering the paint on the canvas.
      </p>

      <p>
        The painting in this example is the universe and the various responses are our interpretations of the design of the universe. There can be any number of ways in which the universe's design can be described. Some can seem more accurate than others, but the only reasonable deduction would be to concede to the last critic's view. We cannot know what the design or order the painter provided within the painting because we are only observers. Further this example, while showing the falliability of humans to recognize design within the universe, is still even stronger than identifying design within the universe to begin with.
      </p>

      <p> 
        For this example to work fully, imagine instead of the painter bringing the critics in, the critics instead just randomly stumbled upon the painting. What can the critics say now. They know nothing about the painter. In the first example, it is possible to maybe know the character of the painter and deduce what the design the painter was trying to achieve was. However, in this latter example, not even that much could be said. Nothing is known about the painter and thus it is impossible to make any definitive or objective statements about the painting.
      </p>

      <p>
        Humans can choose to see all kinds of order and interpreation within the world's "design". However, this does not mean that these interpretations are representative of the true "order" or "design" of the world. Further, just because one can interpret the universe as orderly design does not mean that the world is in fact orderly design. Adhering to an agnostic standpoint, simply we are not in a position to judge wether or not the universe exhibits order in its design. Thus (2) from Swinburne's argument is an unsound premise. Following (4) and further (5) does not follow.
