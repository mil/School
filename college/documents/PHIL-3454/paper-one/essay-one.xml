        Intro Paragraph
      </p>

      <p>
        In <i>The Watch and the Watchmaker</i>, William Paley outlines a simple version of the Teleological argument centered around using the analogy of designed human artifacts having a designer to the universe having a designer to imply God's existence is probable. Stumbling upon a watch, or another human artifact from an unkown source, one can observe a unique design exhibited. A watch is composed of numerous gears, intricite parts, and order. The watch is aligned in just the right manner as to function -- the gears are in just the right alignement, the parts are of the perfect size, and so on. All human artifacts, like the watch, which exhibit design are due to an intelligent human designer. The universe, similar to the watch and other human artifacts,  exhibits a unique design similar to the watch. The universe has certain cycles, order, and design to it to make it function as just so. Thus, similar to the watch having a designer, the universe must have a designer. Further the designer of a universe would require god-like abilities and therefore more likely than not God exists.
      </p>

      <p>
        Hume rejects the teological argument, refusing to accept that the universe has a designer that is God. Firstly, Hume raises the objection that the analogy between the watch and the universe is weak. While a watch exhibits design and order within a confined small and understadle artifact, nature itself is infinitly larger and diverse in size and design. Nature has an insurmountably large design and each facet of its design is unique and uncomparable in its own right. Although we may notice some design and consistancy within what we have discovered about the universe as so far, it is a fallacy to imply that what we have observed about the design of the nature is universally attributional. Much of the universe, for example deep space, is unexplored and it is not rational to assume that what we have not explored of the universe exhibits the same laws of nature which we have explored.
      </p>

      <p>
        Secondly, Hume posits that for as much order and design we find in nature, there could be disorder which we are not capable of recognizing. Just as a peasent cannot understand a complex literary poem, we are not in a position to judge and evaluate the universe as being a great and infalliable design. We know no other universes so by just looking upon our universe we cannot objectivly state if our universe contains any underlying faults or patch-work in design. (Hume, 78)
      </p>

      <p>
        Lastly, Hume grants that even if there were a unique design to the universe we cannot posit it is the work of just one single deity. Just as a house built by numerous construction workers will concede to show the differening handiwork and craftsmenship of each, it could be possible that our universe is the work of multiple dieties. There is no underlying uniformity in the universe's design that we can objectivly identify and thus we cannot concede that the universe is the work of just a single diety. Further, the designers of our artifacts, men, are mortal, reproduce, and are by no means perfect beings. Similarly, the dieties that constructd our universe we could suppose to have similar impefections as man. In fact, why not assume that the dieteies like us have human figures, and are not just in a way super-humans capable of creation of nature?
      </p>

      <p>
        In <i>The Argument from Design</i>, Swinburn rebuts Hume's first objection by emphasizing the notion of regularities of succession within the universe. While Hume wants to say that the universe has no underlying uniform design, Swinburne claims that there is a striking order and consistent design to the universe. Much of the world's phenonememon can be explained in terms of physics, chemistry, and other fields. Such studies can ascribe most phenonmena within the universe in incredibly sucint formuli and logic. Swinburne represents that what we have discovered about the universe illustrates a clear uniformity in nature of the universe.
      </p>

      <p>
        Further, even if our laws science has derived were to be faulty, the important aspect is that the uniformity of nature exists independent of humans. Everything which humans create, that can be observed within the universe, and that has ever existed exhibits a unique order and design.  No matter our formuli and the way humans choose to interpret and understand the basic structure of the design of the universe, it exists independnet of man.
      </p>

      <p>
        Given such uniformity, the watch and similar human artifacts analogy is valid. Additionally, Swinburn critisizes Hume's notion that the design of the universe could be due to multiple deities by adhering to the cosmological argument. Hume claims taht we cannot know about the begining of the universe so its possible to posit a team of deities taht constructed the universe just as likely as there was a single deity. However, it is anthethetical to the practice of philosophy to introduce additional complication wehere there need be not. Further, this inhernet uniformity in the regularities of succession within the univeres illustrate a conform work.
      </p>

      <p>
        If the world were the work of numerous deities, or a team of designers, we would more likely find disorder nature and no conform pattern. Additionally given that there is an underlying order or conformity in nature Swinburne assert that this orderly in nature is either: just design of nature or design of nature created by a God. This design in nature is far to complex to go unexplained. From this Swinburne assert that the probability that this conformity is more likely to occur if God were to exist then not.
      </p>

      <p>
        Now, I will offer my response to Swinburne's responses to Hume's objections of the teological argument. Swinburn's argument for the existence of a single creator of the universe is as follows:
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li>
          There exists a complex physical universe
        </li>
        <li>
          There is a underlying uniformity in the universe that suggests a regularity in succession indepedent of humans.
        </li>

        <li>
          If God were to exist he would have 2 good reasons to produce the order shown by (1) as:
          <ol>
            <li>
              Subpoint
            </li>
            <li>
              Subpoint
            </li>
          </ol>
        </li>

        <li>
          Thus, P((1 &amp; 2) &amp; 3) > P((1 &amp; 2) &amp; ~4)
        </li>

        <li>
          Given (5), God more likely than not exists
        </li>

      </ol>


      <p>
        The problem with Swinburne's argument is that just as he adheres to the Cosmological argument to show the notion of multiple creators as fallacious, I posit that similarly we cannot show (2) to be unsound for similar reasons. While Swinburne wants to claim that there is indeed an underlying uniformity to the universe in nature, this claim is not at all well-grounded. A large part of Swinburne's argument is based on this notion of a temporal order and further that as Swinburne puts it
      </p>

      <p>
        Swinburne's implies that the temporal order of the universe is a purely objective matter. This is not sound. Swinburne's argument relies upon an externalist account of knowledge of the universe.
