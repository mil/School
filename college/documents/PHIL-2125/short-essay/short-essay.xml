      <p>Given that knowledge enters and is resolved through the senses, Montaigne argues that the senses are inadequate for true knowledge. One argument Montaigne employs to support his claim is that senses are unique in that they can only be understood first-hand and further that human senses are not necessarily all of the natural senses in existence.</p>



      <p>Montaigne provides an example of a blind man incapable of understanding the sense of vision. A blind man cannot understand vision but can only interpret, through his own senses, notions of vision others express to him. Suppose a blind picks up a tennis racket, throws a ball up in the air, and hits that ball with his racket. Now suppose, a non-blind person picks up a tennis racket, throws a ball up in the air, hits the ball, and then goes on to watch the ball fly through the air. Well how could the non-blind person describe the ball flying through the air to the blind person? He couldn't and that is exactly the point. Senses are unique and to be fully understood must be experienced first-hand.</p>



      <p>Similar to the blind-non-blind disconnect, humans could be at a disconnect in terms of senses with other inhabitants of existence. Cocks may have an internal clock sense letting them know when morning arrives. Just as the blind man is incapable of understanding vision, humans could be incapable of understanding the cock's clock sense. Montaigne provides numerous examples for ways in which human senses are likely not the only senses in existence.</p>



      <p>Given that each sense produces unlimited amounts of knowledge unique to that sense and provided that humans do not posses all the senses in existence, our senses cannot fully provide true knowledge. Thus, the scope of knowledge is limited to what our human senses can experience.</p>
