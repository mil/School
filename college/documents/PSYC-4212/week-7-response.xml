        This study investigated the difference in behavior in the classroom between children with ADHD and children with working memory impairments. Three rating scales were used to assess the behavioral differences: CTRS, BRIEF, and WMRS. Additionally the CPT was used to provide a more direct measure of persistent attention. The CTRS subset used, the CRS-R, contained 28 brief statements concerning students behavior in which the teacher rates the student on a scale of: not true at all, just a little true, pretty much true, and very much true.  In the BRIEF, 86 questions are asked of the teacher assessing a students behavior as: never, sometimes, or often. And the WMRS consists of 20 questions with a similar behavioral rating scale. The CPT presents the child with a series of 480 characters which appear one at a time on a computer monitor and then the child must press the space bar if and only if the letter is "k". The CPT provides a more direct way to measure attention to provide external validity against the CTRS, BRIEF, and WMRS. It was found that there was a discernible difference in behavior between children with ADHD and those with working memory impairments indicated by the tests. This difference was not highlighted by the WMRS however it was highlighted by the CTRS and the BRIEF. Additionally the CPT was unable to discern between the children with ADHD versus those children with working memory impairments. The CPT was insufficient in discerning between ADHD and WM-impaired children because the CPT seems to measure impulsivity more than all else.
