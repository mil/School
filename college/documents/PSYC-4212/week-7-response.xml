        This study investigated metamemory in 5- and 6-year-olds. A batch of thirty eight 5- and 6- year-olds were individually given a paper containing 2 sets of either perceptual, semantic, or perceptual + semantic items. In the perceptual trials the items were abstract drawn shapes which looked roughly similar in shape. In the semantic trials the items were line drawn images which were semantically related but were not similar in shape. The perceptual + semantic trials had photos that were both similar in shape and category. For each trial, the child was told that a fictional John, had initially seen the 1st set of items and was asked to recall those items by circling them in the 2nd set.  5 of the 8 items in the 2nd set were circled. Of the 5 circled items in the 2nd set, 4 appeared in the 1st set and 1 was not in the 1st set. The 1 item not in the 1st set was either a similar or dissimilar lure.  The child was asked: "Do you think he circled this one because he really thought he saw it earlier, or beacuse he was just guessing?". The resulting answers of the 18 trials (6 perceptual, 6 semantic, and 6 perceptual+semantic) for each child were analyzed by using an 2 x 3 x 2 ANOVA (Age x Array Type x Lure Type). It was found that while the 5-year-olds understanding of the difference between false memories and guesses was insignificant, for 6-year-olds the contrary was true. The 6-year-olds regularly and consistently recognized and discerned between guesses and false memories in answering depending on if the lure was dissimilar or similar. This significant finding in relation to metamemory suggests that when humans misremember past events, their misremeberence is likely related to events prior experienced.
