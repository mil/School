    <div class="response"><p> This study investigated subjects' memory after asked a leading question subsequent to watching a complex fast event.  Four experiments were conducted.  In each experiment subjects watched a short video clip and then filled out a questionnaire containing a large number of filler questions and one key question.  The key question in each experiment was a leading question (containing a false presupposition) designed to influence the results of a subsequent question.  In the control group, the subjects were given the same questionnaire but instead of the key question, a neutral question was present. It was found that asking this one key question in each trial had a strong influence on the subsequent question.  One example of a key question was "How fast was the white sports car going when it passed the barn while traveling along the country road?". The control had the same sentence only omitting "when it passed the barn". In this trial, the subjects had previously seen a video of a sports car traveling however there was not barn. After filling out the questionnaire out with the filler and key or neutral questions, the subjects were asked "Did you see a barn?". Those who were initially asked the question with the false presupposition responded 17.3% yes versus only 2.7% yes for those missing the key question. Each trial found that asking a leading question significantly affected the result of the subsequent question.  The important finding of this study is that it showed that the memory retrieval process is directly influenced by information acquired subsequent to the actual event. This information may be completely irrelevant to the event yet still will be associated with the original memory of the event.
