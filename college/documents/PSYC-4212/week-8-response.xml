        This study investigated the long-term retention of memory and specifically hoped to show there to be no difference between retention of non-schematic and schematic knowledge. Examples of knowledge classified as being non-schematic includes street names or acquaintances names. Examples of schematic knowledge includes the order of the alphabet, composition of chemical formulas, or other semantic information. Prior studies had shown there to be a discernible stratification in the forgetting rate of these two types of knowledge. To disprove such stratification, this study used mailed questionnaires to analyze memory retention of former students of a Dutch elementary school. The questionnaire was mailed to 700 former students and the response was 245 of the students (35%). The main purpose of the questionnaire was to determine accuracy in recall of street names from the town the middle school was situated in. Many related questions which could be correlated to memory retention were included on the questionnaire as well including: personal data, friends in the neighborhood, means of transportation at the time, residence in the town, and related questions. The study employed a multiple regression analysis in analyzing the variables from the questionnaires. Several factors were analyzed as being integral to the forgetting process. The study confirmed its hypothesis that non-schematic and schematic knowledge follow a similar retention memory model. Additionally the study showed that factors such as richness of encoding, retroactive interference, and amount of exposure to the material all play a role in knowledge retention. These finding gives supports the ideal of a unified theory of memory.
