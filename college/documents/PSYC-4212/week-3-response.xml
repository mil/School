      <p>This study used the continuous recognition memory procedure to investigate the effect of alcohol on forgetting. The continuous recognition procedure involves presenting each test subject with a list of 200 items one at a time within a timed setting. In this experiment, the list contained 95 words that appeared twice and 10 words that appeared once. The words in the list were pseudo-randomized -- the list accommodated such that either 1, 4, 9, 19, or 49 intervening items separated the words that appeared twice. The words used were nouns taken from "The American Heritage Word Frequency Book" ranked between 10000 and 11000 in frequency. The words appeared one at a time on a RGB color monitor and the subject could press either the "/" key if they thought the word to be new or the "Z" key  if they though the word was a repeat. Each word remained on the screen for a half of a second. Results were compared between the subjects on two trials during consecutive days. One trial was the baseline or "no alcohol" session and in the other trial the subject had drank an alcoholic beverage prepared for them.</p>

      <p>The study found highly significant results that alcohol increases the time taken to make a correct response and additionally that subjects are more cautious while under the influence of alcohol. The study also showed in its accuracy data that alcohol increases the rate of forgetting. However, unlike a prior study by Wickelgren (1975), this study was unable to demonstrate, in terms of significance, that alcohol increases the rate of forgetting in recognition times.</p>
