        This study investigated 6-month-old infants' ability in top-down language processing. The study employed 3 experiments building upon the use of familiar words to segment and recognize unfamiliar lexical content. A head-turn preference procedure was used to test infants understanding of individual words. The purpose of the first experiment was to confirm the phenomenon in which an infant is able to recognize their own name. The infant was read a number of familiarization passages and subsequently tested for recognition. An example of a familiarization passage was: "Maggie's bike had big, black wheels".  In this passage, the infant's name was Maggie and the familiar word was bike.  It was found that, when a familiar word appeared paired in the passage next to the infant's name, the paired word had a better recognition rate by the infant than control words. The second experiment was similar to the first but instead of the infant's name being used, the infants mothers name was used (either Mommy or Mama). The results of the second experiment concorded with the first in that the infant had a preference for the word paired their her mother's name. A third experiment was conducted to discern between top-down and bottom-up processing. Accordingly the familiar words were paired with the words Tommy and Lola. It was hypothesized and shown that changing the beginning syllable of the Mommy or Moma word would result in no difference in recognition between the familiar and control words. Infants showed no preference for words paired with Tommy or Lola over those words paired with controls. The results of this study show that 6-month-old infants can segment and recognize unfamiliar words by employing knowledge of familiar words in speech in a top-down fashion.
