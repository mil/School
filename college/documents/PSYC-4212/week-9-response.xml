        This study investigated parietal laterality for men and women in two- and three-dimensional mental rotation tasks.  The study used an EEG utilizing the 10/20 placement system for data collection. Thirty-two college students (equal split male and female) were tasked with simple two- and three-dimensional rotational tasks. The experiements took place by each subject being seated at a computer. In the two-dimensional rotational task, on the screen appeared gingerbread men which must be rotated along one axis to fit the sample. Two keys available on the keyboard rotated the gingerbread men along this one axis. The three-dimensional rotational task featured a block that could be rotated on two axes to match the sample figure provided. One un-timed practice trial was provided. The correct trials, task time, and sex were fed into a repeated measured ANOVA for analysis. Additionally, an ANCOVA was used to eliminate potential influence from EEG interference. It was found that on the two-dimensional rotational task men and women performed equally as well. However, on the two-dimensional task men had more left than right parietal activation and the inverse was true for women. On the three-dimension rotational task, men performed better than women and right-parietal activation was more present for both men and women. These results conflict with existing research suggesting that rotation is purely a right parietal task. Men especially had left parietal activation in the two-dimensional task.  Additionally, these results suggest that there are relevant sex difference between men and women in rotational spatial tasks.
