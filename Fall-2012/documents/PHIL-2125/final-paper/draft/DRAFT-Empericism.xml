    <div id="title">The Abductive Approach Toward Locke's Empericism Versus Leibniz's Rationalism</div>
    <div class="response">
      <p><b>(A)</b><br/>I will present the philosophical debate between Locke's empiricism and Leibniz's rationalism. An important consequence of the empiricism versus rationalism debate is the matter of:  <b>Which is the better abductive inferential explanation... as such debate has no firm deductive answer -- it will likely be reduced to an inference to the best explanation (I.B.E). Taking an I.B.E route, Locke's empiricism, not assuming innate necessary truths, seems a far less assumption-laden hypothesis and further we can safely assert that at least some knowledge is derived from experience while, we cannot safely assert that at least some knowledge is innate.</b>
      </p>

      <p><b>(B)</b> Leibniz's Rationalist Argument:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>The senses can only ever give us knowledge of singular or instances of experiences.</li>
        <li>We will never be able to observe all instances of any one thing.</li>
        <li>The instances we've observed of a particular thing can not be said to be always generalizable (instances cannot provide logical necessity).</li>
        <li>Thus: The senses are only able to provide us with contingent knowledge of the world but not necessary knowledge.</li>
      </ol>

      <p><b>(C)</b> Locke's Empiricist Argument:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>It is possible to attain knowledge without appealing to innate ideas.</li>
        <li>Even ideas deemed innate by rationalists such as Leibniz's primary truths must be discovered by way of experience.</li>
        <li>Thus: There are no innate truths. All knowledge is derived from experience.</li>
      </ol>

      <p class="break">
        <b>(D)</b><br/>The rationalist versus empiricist argument matters because it defines the fundamental model for how we view knowledge. Locke's argument seems stronger than Leibniz's argument in the notion that such dilemma is naturally prone to reduce to an inference to the best explanation style or abductive problem. While Leibniz wants to say that we have innate knowledge and the senses are inadequate for necessary truths, this is seemingly not a claim that has the possibility of being well grounded. How can we prove such innate ideas independent of experience? Isolate a human from its culture, society, or environment? Even so, we would never be able to determine if these innate ideas do in fact exist independent of experience because we cannot isolate a human from experience all together. Leibniz wants to philosophize on the notion of necessary truths, such as those seen in mathematical equations and such. However, who are we to say these truths did not originate from one's experience? We, as humans,are incapable of separating ourselves from experience. Thus how can we hold responsible anything which is claimed to be isolated from experience?
      </p>

      <p>
        The more logical and simpler inference to the best explanation in rationalism versus empiricism is to venture down the empirical route. While the same skeptical criticism of not knowing where in fact our knowledge is derived from persists, we can at least say that <i>some</i> knowledge must be derived from experience. Such if someone grows up in a different culture they may have a very different accounts of particular things. This seems as a stronger kind of inference and thus a safer route to head down in the empiricist versus rationalist debate.
