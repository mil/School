    <div id="title">Nietzsche's Solution to the Meaning of Life</div>
    <div class="response">
      <p>
      Both Lois Hope Walker and Friedrich Nietzsche would agree that without God, life is devoid of an "ultimate" value or purpose. However, the two authors would disagree whether the implications of there being no "ultimate" value or purpose to life outside of God is good. To this extent, Walker advocates theism; while Nietzsche advocates atheism. Following, I will explore the difference in rationale for each author and show Nietzsche's atheism in viewing God to not exist to be good. In (I), I will give an account of why Nietzsche thinks that it is good that God does not exist. In (II), I will offer one of Walker's argument for theism in refutation of Nietzsche's argument. In (III), I will offer a reply that Nietzsche would give in response to Walker's argument for theism. Finally, concluding in (IV), I will introduce a potential counter-argument to Nietzsche's argument for atheism and explain why said counter-argument is unsatisfactory in affecting Nietzsche's argument.

      <h2>I. Nietzsche: The Herd Creates Value or You Create Value</h2>
      <p>
      Nietzsche's argued that it is good that God does not exist because if God did exist then all actions would be subject to God's judgment. Further, if we look at the way "God" is defined in the Judeo-Christian sense of Morality (JCM), "God" is nothing more than an embodiment of herd-instinct in humans. Further, Nietzsche argued that actions being subject to evaluation from herd-instinct (God) suppresses the individual from judging his actions within his own construal. 
      </p>
      <p> 
      To understand Nietzsche's argument we must first understand "herd-instinct" separate from the term "God".  Nietzsche viewed that humans are <i>herd animals</i> from a biological level and for herd animals all moral choices in life are guided to <i>support the herd</i>. Nietzsche describes this phenomenon as: "wherever we encounter morality, we find an evaluation... of human drives and actions. These evaluations... are always the expression of the needs of a community and herd: that which benefits <i>it</i> the most... Morality is herd-instinct in the individual" (Nietzsche 114).  To this Nietzsche added that not only are moral choices guided to benefit of the herd, but further that <i>every</i> choice in life can be seen as ultimately a moral choice in regard to benefiting the herd.  
      </p>
      <p>
      Building on the idea that humans are herd animals and every choice one makes in life is merely a moral choice in regards to benefiting the herd, Nietzsche argued that God is merely an embodiment of this herd-instinct's morality.  In JCM, God is set to be the ultimate judge of a man's character. Certain actions a man performs are deemed good in virtue of appealing to God's judgment while other actions are deemed bad in regards to not appealing to God's judgment. One virtue that is said to be of very high value in regards to God's judgment within the JCM context is the notion of altruism. Altruism orders that we should place value on the well-being of others. We should care about the less fortunate, needy, or anybody who has less power in life than we do. From altruism, a highly valued virtue within JCM, we quickly find a paradigm expression of herd-instinct. Altruism gives a member of the herd an opportunity precisely to serve as a <i>function</i> of the embodiment of the herd. As Nietzsche puts it: "In many people I see a surplus strength and pleasure in wanting to become a function; they press toward and have the most delicate sense for all places where precisely they can be a function" (Nietzsche 116).
      </p>
      <p>
      Thus, from Nietzsche's argument that God and specifically JCM God's values are merely an embodiment of herd-morality, Nietzsche argues that belief in God is a bad thing because it suppresses the value of the individual. If one accepts God's values, one merely accepts the values of the herd and suppresses the values of the individual themself.  Believing in God's values is merely to be a function of the herd and loose any sense in which you may create your own value system. A world with God is a world where the individual may be punished, feel remorseful, and be subject to judgment at the vice of the welfare of the herd. The world is only "good" and "evil" because the JCM God chooses the view the world as good and evil. The universe itself, without the God, is value neutral and viewing the universe as an atheist frees one self to be the judge of one's own character and virtue.  Thus, it is a good thing that God does not exist, for if he did exist then we would be subject to God's value system and incapable of judging ourselves on our own merit. A shared value system is the mere embodiment of the values of the herd-instinct in humans.
      </p>
      <p>
      Without accepting that God exists, individuals are free to value whatever they want. Humans may naturally value certain things: art, self-expression, individuality, and so on... however so long as "God" exists, the individual must choose: value things that the individual personally finds valuable <i>or</i> value things that "God" (or the herd) finds valuable.  As such, it is good that God does not exist because in a world free from God, the individual is free to place value on whatever he wants and develop his <i>own</i> virtues and value system.
      </p>

      <h2>II. Walker: Why We Should Accept God's Values and Truth</h2>
      <p>In <i>Religion Gives Meaning to Life</i>, Walker offers an argument for theism by asserting that belief in God is required to achieve freedom.  Walker posits that freedom should be understood in the context of oneself having <i>freedom</i> for one's actions to achieve or work towards a goal.  Religion gives us an ultimate "goal" or truth for life in that "religion claims to offer us the truth about the world".  Thus belief in God is necessary "since having true beliefs is important in reaching one's goals, it follows that our autonomy is actually heightened in having the truth about the purpose of our lives" (Walker 1).  
      </p>
      <p>
      Walker posits that that religion and having a life that is rooted in "truth" or enables us to be free in conforming individual actions to said "truth". Individual actions are free in virtue that they can be subsequently judged in whether they seek the ultimate truth or not. God can be seen as creating the ultimate "truth" of life and thus belief in God is the bedrock for which all other true beliefs can be grounded. With God or an ultimate truth, we are free to seek the ultimate truth of our own lives and thus our free actions enable use to lead truly a virtuous life.
      </p>
      <p>
      Under Nietzsche's atheism, there is no inherent goal or truth to life. One has to determine one's own purpose of life. According to Nietzsche, there is no inborn goal, value, or purpose to life (such that God creates) and thus it follows then that one's life has no true virtuous freedom. Individual actions have no goal or ultimate truth to conform to and subsequently we cannot judge individual actions in virtue of them conforming to an ultimate truth.  Without overarching goal or truth, we cannot evaluate individual actions in regards to whether they are good or bad but rather view them <i>in isolation</i>. All beliefs viewed in isolation without adherence to God or a fundamental truth, are all meaningless. Thus, without God, our lives are a meaningless void in which individual actions are automatically deemed as not being free because there is no fundamental truth.
      </p>

      <h2>III. Nietzschian Reply to Walker: God's "Ultimate Truth" Value is Arbitrary</h2>
      <p>
      Nietzsche would likely prima facie reject Walker's argument in (II) because she does not consider that her belief in God is rooted in herd-instinct values and deprived of any individual value. However, for the moment let us entertain that Nietzsche might agree that belief in God has some value because God gives our individual actions an "ultimate truth".  As such, if we believe in God, if we ever need an answer to which actions are good or bad, we will know -- those actions which God commands. These moral actions which God command are the "ultimate truth" and we may be fideistic and need not question any further. Thus, as a result of Walker's line of argumentation: all actions in life can be now seen as epistemically and morally grounded. We know the "ultimate truth" and all we had to do was simply believe in God.
      </p>
      <p>
      To the view illustrated above, while I do concede that God may be <i>one</i> "ultimate truth" in solving all epistemic and moral problems, I do not think in any sense God is <i>the</i> "ultimate truth" to solving all epistemic and moral problems. In line with Nietzsche's perspectivism, I believe that Nietzsche would likely deem Walker's advocacy for theism as <i>one perspective</i> on solving the problem of an "ultimate truth" of life. Yes, you can view God to exist and be the "ultimate truth" of your life... however this is only one perspective to how to view the "ultimate truth" of one's life. Furthermore, the perspective for which Walker argues is simply a fideistic defense of the herd-instinct. Walker's solution that God provides an "ultimate truth" works for the pragmatist fideist that simply does not want to think any further about what <i>their</i> ultimate truth or purpose of life is. This solution works fine however it is completely contrary to what Nietzsche teaches us in regards to how to view the problem of there being no inherent purpose to life.
      </p>

      <p>
      While both Nietzsche and Walker would agree that without God there is no inherent purpose to life, only Nietzsche would concede in fact that from the start that there was no ultimate purpose to life. If Walker agreed that there was no God, then Walker's life would be meaningless. For Nietzsche however, the story is different, there being no inherent meaning to life is a reason to <i>create your own</i> meaning to life. Walker, however, unfortunately however lacks the creative skills to deem her own values in life and thus she must rely on God as being her life's "ultimate truth".
      </p>
            <h2>IV. Counter-Objection to Nietzsche: The Pragmatism of Belief in God</h2>
      <p>
      In response to (III), the reader might assert that regardless of whether God is <i>the</i> "ultimate truth" or <i>one</i> "ultimate truth", you're never going to do better than accepting <i>one</i> "ultimate truth". Or in other words, believing in God is pragmatic because it provides one "ultimate truth" and isn't that good enough?  To this line of argumentation, I will concede that believing in a JCM God in the grand scheme of things (or biologically) is likely no different than being an eccentric existentialist quoting Nietzsche when your religion is questioned. 
      </p>
      <p> 
      However, I will ask several last questions of the reader: how much do you care about being an individual? How much do you care about reasoning? And how much do you care about finding answers for yourself? If your answer to any of those questions is at least "a bit", you're most likely not pragmatic enough to disregard this discussion. Thus, we find out of nihilism grows an interesting dilemma which Nietzsche provides us with: accept "God" exists and creates an "ultimate truth" of life <i>or</i> accept that God does not exists and make your own "ultimate truth" for life. If you've been conditioned enough by society you'll simply accept the former and be a happy fideist. If you call yourself an individual you'll most likely need to accept the latter.  Finally, if you're an pragmatic agnostic who thinks this disjunction need not concern you: think again because not choosing is a choice for the former in and of itself.
