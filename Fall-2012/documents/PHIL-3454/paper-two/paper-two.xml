    <div id="title">The Omnipotent Paradox's Only Solution: Faith</div>
    <div class="response">
      <p>
        The Problem of Evil can be explained as: it seems contradictory for evil to exist in the world if there is indeed a 3 Os God such that God is: omnipotent (all powerful), omnibenevolant (wholly good), and omniscient (all knowing). The Problem of Evil can be seen as problematic for the theist subscribing to a 3 Os God on several fronts including: Why would an omnibenevolant God continue to allow evil to exist in the world since if God were omnipotent, God could stop said evil? Why would an omnibenevolant God who is also all knowing create a world or even set into motion a world with evils? The number of apparent contradictions for a 3 Os God arising out of the Problem of Evil are numerous and seemingly legitimate. A particularly interesting objection to the Problem of Evil which I would like to focus on is known as the greater good argument (<i>GG</i>). <i>GG</i> attempts to solve the Problem of Evil by showing that: evil is necessary for greater good.  Proceeding, I will show how particularly <i>GG</i> can be used to solve the Problem of Evil, how the <i>GG</i> argument fails in its solution in light of the Omnipotent Paradox (<i>OP</i>), and finally offer additional argumentation in support of <i>OP</i> by refuting potential counterarguments to <i>OP</i>.
      </p>

      <p>
        Firstly I will provide a reconstruction of the greater good argument (<i>GG</i>) which can be found in writings of numerous theist authors. My re-construction will focus primarily on argumentation offered by Gottfried Leibniz in <i>Theodicy: A Defense of Theism</i> (p.153). Leibniz presents <i>GG</i> as:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Man was given free will</li>
        <li>Out of free will arises evil</li>
        <li>Evil enables greater good</li>
        <li>Thus: Evil is a necessary component of greater good</li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        It it necssary at this point that I distinguish what exactly Leibniz means by greater good before I offer counter-argumentation. Greater goods are goods that arise out of virtuous action only enabled by evil. One example of a greater good would be that of the virtuous and wholly good actions seen in response to the tragic event of a hijacked plane crashing into the World Trade Center on September 11th, 2001. While thousands died on that fateful day, as a result of that tragedy, an even greater good arose. This greater good was that thousands of firefighters and policeman demonstrated the virtues of heroism in saving the lives of innocent civilians trapped in the rubble. Additionally, an entire nation was united for days, weeks, and even years after the attack in mourning. This sense of nationalism and heroism would have never been possible without that initial tragic event caused by evil. In this case, the greater good outweighed the evil that enabled it and thus God acted in omnibenevolence. Although Leibniz's <i>GG</i> only implicitly assumes (by name) that greater goods are in fact <i>greater</i> or of <i>more significance</i> than normal or first-order goods, it is easy to formulate or find alternative accounts of <i>GG</i> which explicitly state this. Regardless, the matter of whether greater goods are in fact more valuable than ordinary goods is not essential for <i>GG</i>. As long as the value of greater goods are such that they outweigh the evils in the world needed to produce them, <i>GG</i> remains valid. 
      </p>

      <p>
        The main objection I wish to present in the face of <i>GG</i> is a nasty side-effect introduced by premise (1), that: Man was given free will.  The side-effect which I speak of is the Omnipotent Paradox (<i>OP</i>) which is best construed by J.L. Mackie in <i>Evil and Omnipotence</i>. Consider the following reconstruction of Mackie's derivation of <i>OP</i> (p.179-180):
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li>God is Omnipotent, Omnibenevolant, and Omniscient</li>
        <li>If God is Omnipotent then God can control man's free-will</li>
        <li>God can control man's free-will <i>[From 1-2]</i></li>
        <li>Either freedom (free-will) is a virtue God values more than good or God cannot control man's free-will <i>[From 1 &amp; 3]</i></li>
          <li>Freedom is <i>not</i> a virtue God values more than good <i>[From 1]</i></li>
        <li>Thus: God cannot control man's free-will <i>[From 4-5]</i></li>
      </ol>

      <p>
        Derived from the given assumption of (1) and the harmless additional assumption of (2), resulting: (3) and (6) arise as contradictory -- showing <i>OP</i>. The question the paradox presents us will with is: "can an omnipotent being make things which he cannot subsequently control?". Mackie also adds that <i>OP</i> naturally additionally leads to to the question of: "can an omnipotent being make rule which then bind himself?" (p.179).
      </p>

      <p>
        When considering <i>OP</i>, a first intuition for the theist may be to question premise 3. Mainly the theist may ask the question of: is it safe to assume that God values good more than free will? In this vein, the theist  may  appeal to re-hash the greater good argument in terms of multiple orders of goodness. If it is such that the theist can re-hash <i>GG</i> such that the sense in which God is omnibenevolent brings into question the soundness of premise 3, possibly <i>OP</i> could be avoided. To introduce an alternative interpretation of omnibenevolence, the theist could assert that: while humans understand second order goods, such as heroism (which require evils), there may additionally be third order goods such that only God can understand why they are wholly good. Consequently, the theist could hold that the omnibenevolence that God employs is a third-order good beyond the scope of human understanding. This idea is often reinforced in common culture with phrases such as "God works in mysterious ways" or "God knows best". 
      </p>
      <p>
        The problem with re-hashing <i>GG</i> in this way to avoid <i>OP</i> is that it is a solution that requires a great deal of of faith. The theist's wants to assert that: God's omnibenevolence is such that we are incapable of understanding it but regardless we must live with evils, in light of the fact that only God knows of the overarching greater good. I plainly do not see how a completely rational entity could accept this re-hash of <i>GG</i>. This style of reasoning requires significant amounts of faith and is truly best deemed plainly as fideism. To the fideist, I simply do not have the proper deductive argumentation to reply. Irregardless, I can show that this re-hash of <i>GG</i> cannot save the theist from the Problem of Evil. As it turns out, <i>OP</i> can be wrought out in presence of a solely omnipotent God just as easily as it can be wrought out in presence of a 3 Os God. Consider the following minimal proof which leads to <i>OP</i> assuming only a solely omnipotent God who is not omnibenevolent or omniscient:
        </p>

      <ol>
        <li>God is Omnipotent</li>
        <li>An Omnipotent God could command that: God himself could no longer control man</li>
        <li>Thus: It is possible that God is no longer omnipotent <i>[From 1-2]</i></li>
      </ol>

      <p>
        This minimal and more generalized derivation of <i>OP</i> shows the unavoidability of the paradox. So then what is it about the setup of <i>OP</i> which leads to the paradox. What can the theist at this point call into question?  Well, if theist asserts that at one time God existed and was a 3 Os God however, now God no longer exists... then it looks like you are in the clear of <i>OP</i>.  However, a theist arguing for a 3 Os God surely would like to provide a richer notion of God's existence, primarily that the 3 Os God exists now, has always existed, and will always continue to exist. Surely, the  theist would not like to concede that God is dead. This leads us to an alternative counter-argument that the theist could offer playing on the temporal tie of <i>OP</i>, mainly that: God exists outside of the limitations temporal order.  If the theist insists that God is not constrained by notions of time, that would seem to cripple the problems brought out by <i>OP</i>. As such, God transcends time and thus we cannot understand God's omnipotence from our temporal order. So, we simply do not have the proper faculties to say whether God could or could not perform some action that later impended on his omnipotence. Could God limit his own omnipotence at a later date than he was granted it (if he was so granted)? Well, we can't say. This style question cannot be asked of a God whose existence transcends time.
      </p>

      <p>
        Thus, I will grant that <i>if</i> the temporal aspect is eliminated from the the portrayal of a 3 Os God, then <i>OP</i> ceases to be a problem for the theist asserting <i>GG</i>. However, it seems except to avoid the problems introduced by <i>OP</i>, God existing independent of temporal order is not in line with the classical theologian's portrayal of a 3 Os God. So in order to show God's existence to transcend time the theist must either: accept the premise ad-hoc as to avoid <i>OP</i> or simply have faith that this is the case as to avoid <i>OP</i>. Either way seems insufficient but likely to this proposition, the theist would likely rather accept an argument from faith rather than an ad-hoc argument.  Thus, the theist is right back where he started when introduced to <i>OP</i>. As we have seen with each counter-reply to <i>OP</i>, the theist's reasoning must be reducing to a sense of fideism in each instance. I am willing to grant that <i>OP</i> is a problem for <i>GG</i> that can be solved in numerous ways by requiring faith. I could go on all day listing ways in which the the theist might appeal to faith to dissolve <i>OP</i>, however, we are concerned with logical and deductive discourse. Thus, I do not consider requiring faith to show the 3 Os God's existence to be an acceptable solution.
