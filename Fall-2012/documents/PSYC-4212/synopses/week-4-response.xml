      <p>This study investigated the CSLE at the optimal viewing position (OVP) in the Stroop task. The Stroop task requires participants to identify the color of a word when the written word itself is contrary its color (for example: "red" written in blue ink). The Stroop effect, produced by this task, shows elongation in the response time and accuracy of identifying the correct color of the word. Besner, Stolz, and Boutilier (1997) later expanded on the Stroop task by showing that coloring only a single letter in the Stroop task reduced the Stroop effect significantly (CSLE). This study expanded on testing the CSLE when the colored letter of the word was at the OVP (the position at which word recognition time is the shortest). Participants were presented with 168 word trials (36 practice, 72 full word colored, and 96 one letter colored). The words appeared one at a time on a screen and unlimited amount of time was given for each verbal response. It was found that when the color carrier in the word was at the OVP (just left of the middle-letter) the CSLE was not present. At all other single letter positions of the word, the CSLE persisted and showed significant Stroop effect reduction. A second experiment was conducted in order to determine whether a position effect was present when the colored letter was at the point of initial fixation. The second experiment supported the results of the first in showing that the CSLE was present in all letter positions except for the OVP. This was an intriguing study and the question it really leaves us with is: why was the CSLE not present at the OVP? Why is there a Stroop effect at the OVP?</p>
