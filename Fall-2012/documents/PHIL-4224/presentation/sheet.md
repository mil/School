In Defence of Sartwell's True Belief Analysis of Knowledge
==========================================================
In the face of Gettier, the epistemologist intuits that the **JTB** analysis of knowledge should be morphed into **JTB + X** (where X is some component that seeks to exclude Gettier cases from JTB). Another option, presented by Crispin Sartwell, in *Knowledge is Merely True Belief* and *Why Knowledge is Merely True Belief* is to instead skin **JTB** into **TB**.  

As a precursor to **TB**, Sartwell emphasizes several methodological points for his anlaysis of knowledge:

1. An analysis of knowledge should be **teleological** and **normative**.
2. **Belief** should be a **stricter** notion; **disposition to assent** of proposition p is **different** from **entertaining that p**.
3. Epistemological theories of justification serve to **conduce the truth**.

Methodological Distinctions in Analyses of Knowledge
----------------------------------------------------
- **Deontological** versus **Teleological**
    * **Deontological**
        - No overarching "project" or "goal"
        - Concerned with: obligations, permission, duties
    * **Teleological**
        - Concerned with the overall or overaching "goal"
        - The ends rather than the means
- **Normative** versus **Descriptive**
    * **Normative**
        - How should we generate belief in regards to acquiring knowledge?
        - What is the model or how can we talk about knowledge philosophically?
    * **Descriptive**
        - Branch of psychology or cognitive science 
        - What are the cognitive mechanisms or belief formation?

A Primer on Belief
------------------
- **Braithewaite's Account of Belief**:
    * **S** holds belief **p** iff the following 2 conditions are met:
        1. **S** entertains that **p**.
        2. **S** has a disposition to act as if **p** were true.
- **(2) Often Seen in Absence of (1)**
    * Does a gambler who closes his eyes and draws his finger to a horse on a betting form hold the belief that the horse will win?
    * A man awakes from brain surgery asserting he believes Goldbach's Conjecture. Does he have belief?

Justification: Conducive to the Truth
-------------------------------------
- What do foundationalism, coherentism, and all other theories of justification have in common?
    * They all hold that justification primary seeks to conduce to the truth.
    * Justification is thus just of instrumental value to knowledge.
- A Quote from Bonjour:
    * "If finding epistemically justified beliefs did not substantially increase the likelihood of finding true ones, epistemic justification would be irrelevant to our main cognitive goal and of dubious worth... epistemic justification is therefore in the final analysis only an instrumental value, not an intrinsic one"

Sartwell's Proof for Why K=TB
-----------------------------
1. Knowledge is the deontological goal of inquiry. 
    - (inquiry defined as: procedures that have their goal in the generation of belief)
2. Justification is a correct normative procedure for inquiry.
3. Justification is a means to knowledge. [From 1-2]
4. X beings a means to Y does not make X a necessary component of Y.
5. **Thus:** Justification is only an instrumental component of knowledge.
