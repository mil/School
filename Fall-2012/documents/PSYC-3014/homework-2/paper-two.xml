    <div id="title">The Misportrayal of Dissociative Identity Disorder in Fight Club</div>
    <div class="response">
      <p>
        <i>Fight Club</i> is an movie which portrays a individual suffering from dissociative identity disorder in the way only Hollywood blockbuster could. The narrator, who remains nameless, experiences symptoms of dissociative identity disorder in which he exhibits two distinct and unique personalities. In one personality the narrator is a faceless drone, at the leash of consumerism, working a desk job for an automotive company. The narrator's other personality is Tyler Durden: an eccentric, bold, societal-rebel, anti-hero who leads a fight club which soon expands into a anecdote for societal anarchy and rebellion dubbed "Project Mayhem". From a psychological stand-point the narrator of <i>Fight Club</i> could most definitely be diagnosed with dissociative identify disorder. However, as I will explore throughout the course of this paper, the narrator's interaction with the Tyler Durden personality as a hallucination suggests that not only was the narrator suffering from dissociative identity disorder, but likely the narrator experienced a co-morbidity with schizophrenia. That said, this kind of diagnosis is rare in the literature and thus the mix of dissociative identity disorder and schizophrenia seems to most likely serve as a Hollywood glorification. Digging into the display of psychological symptoms experienced by the narrator of <i>Fight Club</i>, the depiction of mental-illness wrought out can be seen in large part as wholly inaccurate.

        As a precursor to my critical analysis, I will give a brief summary of the plot of <i>Fight Club</i>.  The movie introduces the narrator (who remains nameless) as  an insomniac, corporate drone, who holds a desk job at an automobile company. The narrator is drowning in consumerism, suffers from relentless insomnia, and finds relief for his insomnia by attending a support group for testicular cancer. The narrator meets a man by the name of Tyler Durden on a flight. After the narrator's apartment explodes in a chance misfortune, the narrator meets back up with Tyler and the two men form a deep relationship after starting a fight. As the plot develops, the narrator moves into the abandoned house in which Tyler lives. The two men start a fight club operating out of the basement of a bar. The fight club quickly expands into a movement spanning multiple locations and embodying an anti-corporation, anarchistic, and anti-consumerist movement known as Project Mayhem. The narrator grows increasingly uncomfortable with Project Mayhem and struggles in coping with Tyler. Soon it becomes aware to the narrator that Tyler is a figment of his imagination, a personality of the narrator himself, and when the narrator is asleep Tyler is awake.  The movie culminates in a struggle for the narrator to control Tyler as Tyler destroys several credit card company buildings. Concluding, the narrator non-fatally shoots himself in the mouth somehow killing Tyler, however the narrator remains alive.

        From a clinical psychology perspective it is obvious that the narrator suffers from dissociative identity disorder. Interestingly however, not only does the narrator experience two distinct personalities but these two personalities interact. How other people see the narrator interacting with his own delusions is open to interpretation but this is assuredly not a symptom of dissociative identity disorder. As such it is unclear how exactly the narrator can interact with delusions of the Tyler Durden personality from his personality. One possibility is that the narrator has a co-morbidity with schizophrenia. This would be consistent with the narrator's initial problems of insomnia which he tries to diagnose at the beginning of the movie. He winds up diagnosing his insomnia by going to a support-group for testicular cancer and faking being a member of the support-group to eases his pain. The support group allows him to get to sleep at night. However, as the Tyler Durden hallucination emerges and fight club activity begins the narrator stops going to the support group. He believes he's found something better: interacting with Tyler and being a part of fight club.

        Thus, the line is blurry where dissociative identity disorder ends and schizophrenia might begin in the narrator. To further complicate the matter: it is unclear how the narrator's hallucination of Tyler Durden could be such a clear-thinking agent not suffering from schizophrenia himself. In other words - it seems as if the narrator's schizophrenic hallucinations are only apparent to the one personality. The Tyler Durden personality serves as more of a ad-hoc personality in addition to the narrator's personality. This is not quite consistent with dissociative identity disorder as patients typically have unique personalities and it's not as if one dictates the other or one is the "central" personality. Further, while often patients with dissociative identity disorder have uniquely distinct personalities unaware of the traits of one another, the personality of Tyler Durden directly reflects the deficiencies the narrator experiences. Tyler Durden embodies the presence of everything that the narrator is not. As Brad Pitt, who plays Tyler Durden, puts it to the narrator: "I look like you wanna look, I fuck like you wanna fuck, I am smart, capable, and most importantly, I'm free in all the ways that you are not".  These discrepancies illustrate the misrepresentation of psychological disorders in <i>Fight Club</i>. Hence, it is apparent that the movie's writer was not fully studied on the psychological symptoms he presented as far as their coherence to anecdotal psychological disorders.

        The general overt message construed from <i>Fight Club</i> about the state of somebody with dissociative identity disorder is much more of a dramatization than is actually the case. The narrator of <i>Fight Club</i> does not have textbook schizophrenia or textbook dissociative identity disorder. Rather, the narrator presents an interesting mix of both that makes for an incredibly entertaining plot. However, this depiction serves as a wholly misguided representation of both disorders. As such, <i>Fight Club</i> does not portray mental illness in a positive light but rather illustrates mental illness experienced by the narrator to be a sign of erratically spurred psychological symptoms. Implicitly, this movie could be said to even be quite harmful for society's depiction of mental illness. The movie essentially draws a picture of the narrator of being a psychologically disturbed creature experiencing a mix of the most bizarre psychological symptoms. Does it make for an incredibly entertaining story? Yes, however it is a dangerous depiction of mental illness and if used as a source for information on mental illness then this movie is wholly inaccurate.

        Aside from the utter inaccuracy of mental illness portrayed in <i>Fight Club</i>, it remains one of my favorite movies. Prior to taking abnormal psychology, I had no idea about the actual symptoms of schizophrenics, insomniacs, or those suffering from dissociative identity disorder. Thus, perhaps the depiction of mental illness presented by <i>Fight Club</i> is dangerous for society. Accordingly, my view of these mental illness disorders without further study in the field of psychology was misinformed thanks in a large part to Hollywood. However, while I concede to these inaccuracies, we must take <i>Fight Club</i> for what it is: an over-dramatization of mental illness, an epic thriller, and a captivating creative work that portrays a world in which psychological disorders are not quite on par with our own world.
