- Pro DCT:
    * The Threat of Nihilism (DOstoevsky)
    * "God must determine what is good and bad; otherwise, nothing would determine what's good or bad" Consider:
        - If I give to charity, that is a right action beac use it helps people
            * (Why is helping people right?)
            * Helping people is right because people are valuable (Why are people valuable)?)
            * Poeple are valuable because they are created by God for some large purpoe (End of Questions)
    * SO you neecd gGod to explain why people (and virtous actions are valuable)
- Evolutiontionary Mortality
    * An action is right (/wrong) precisely because it is evolutionary adaptive(/maladaptive)
    * Objection:
        - ET: What's evolutionar good is not always what's morraly good. (Evolution doesn't catre about how happy wqe are; 
- Weirdly, ET Faces the Same Objections As DCT
    * Objection 1: (Euthyphro Dilemma) 
        - Is an act right because natural law says so, 
        - or does natural law say so because it is right? 
        - If the former, natural law seems arbitrary. If the latter, then NLT is false.
    * Objection 2:  (Circularity)
        - Why should we do what natural law says? Because natural law says so?
    * Reply 2: Humanism [Sarte] 
        - An act is good because it maximizes human well-being
        - STILL... Humanism faces the circulairty worry
        - Why is it good to maximize human well-being?
            * Because it maximizes human well-being?
        - A one instance of the question:
            * Why does MY life ultimately matter???
