-  Classical Conditioning A Review
- Phobias
    * A persistent and and disproportionate fear of some specific object or situation that presents little or no actual danger and yet leads to a great deal of avoidance of these feared sitautions
    * 3 Main Categories:
        - Specific Phobia

                    * Cued by the presence or anticipation of a specific object or situation
                - Exposure to phobic stimulus almost invariably provokes an immediate anxiety response or panic attack
                - Person recognizes that the fear is excessive or unreasonable
                - Phobic situation avoided or endured with intense anxiety or distress.

            * Evolutionary preparedness - evolutionary history has impact on stimuli we most likely come to fear
                - Human monkey experiments: contiioning to various stimuli
        - Individual Differences
            * Why do some individuals devlop phobias after traumatic experiences wheras others do not?
