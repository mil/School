What ought we believe?
======================
- Alston
    * [X] Basic control
    * [X] Immediate Non-Basic Control
    * [X] Long Term Planning Control
    * Indirect Influence 
        - Intellectual habbit building
        - (Only sense in which we ought to believe)
    * Skeptical Conclusion:
        - You ought to belive b if believe b is/would be justified
        - What you woudl believe had you exercized appropriate indirect influence
            * This is not the same as traditional epistemological justification
        - Traditional conception of Justification is sense of truth seeking
        - But there are cases with indirect influence that don't have to do with truth
            * That don't put you in position to get the truth
    * Thus: Deontological sense of justification and traditional epistemological j sense come apart
- Foley
    * A (epistemically) rational belief is ...epistemically rational for you to believe...
- Fumerton
    * Ought to believe: praiseworthy belief
    * OUght not to believe: blameworthy/critizable belief
    * Praise/Blame is neither (sufficient) nor necessary for normativity
        - sufficient: blameworthy, -> ought not have
    * its not a good criticism of externalism to say it doesn't account for epimstemic normaitivity
        - there is no good sense
        - no good epistemic sense in which yu ought to belive in which tracks traditional
