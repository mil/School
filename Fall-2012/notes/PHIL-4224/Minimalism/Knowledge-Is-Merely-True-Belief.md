Knowledge is Merely True Belief
===============================
- Belief must be treated in a propositional attitude

- Four Counter-Examples of K = TB
    1. Dream that Pythagoreon theroem is true
        * Come to believe that it is true
    2. Close eyes and bet on horse.
        * Horse wins the race
    3. Mad scientist antheciszes you
        * Goldbach's conjexture is true
    4. Because reading tea leaves, swallows have returned

- On Beliefs
    * No belief stands in isolation
        - Each belief requires related beliefs
        - Ex: Cant have conjecture Goldbach's conjecture is true and fail to have related beliefs
        
    * One can act as if he holds a belief
    * Usually a lucky guess is not even a belief

- How Do You Know?
    * It can always be further asked "how do you know?"
    * In response at some point for practical reasons
        - At somepoint one is self-justified
        - Or Prima Facie justified

- Counter Examples to JTB
    * Flash of Insight
        - Mathmeticians sees the solution
        - Subterranean justification
        - I "knew" it, turns out to be true
            * Not strictly "justified"
    * If God were to exist, religious faith would count as K
        - But religious faith doesn't have justification
        - Or easier: Father whose son is accused of murder
            * believe in face of great evidence son is innocent
            * Asked how he knows: "I just do"
            * Son turns out to be innocent
            * Did the father not know?
    * "I knew it all along"
        - Nixon involved in Watergate coverup
        - t2 Find evidence and are now "justified"
        - Did you not know prior to evidence at t2?

    * Thus: 
        - Justification is not a Necessary Condition of Knowledge

- Justification & Truth
    * Justification is a criterion for K
        - J is not necessary condition of K
    * J is Criteria as test if we are in doubt
    * J is a pragmatic rather than conceptual component of a
        - J is to show that conceptual components of K met
    * Must question doxastic procedures
        - Does the mental hospital patient hold beliefs?
    * When we ask somehow how they "know" something?
        - We are doing one of two things:
            1. Establish wheter the eprson knmows versus believes it
            2. Assess rationality of person 

- Externalism versus Internalism
    * K=TB avoids this debate all together
    * Ext vs In arises from idea that J is logically required for K
