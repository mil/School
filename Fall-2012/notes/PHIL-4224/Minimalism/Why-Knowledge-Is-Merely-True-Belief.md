Why Knowledge is Merely True Belief -- Crispin Sartwell
=======================================================
- Terminological Groundwork
    * Knowledge = Our Epistemic goal in the generation of particular propositional beliefs
    * Inquiry = Procedures that have as their goal generation of belief with regard to particular propositions
        * There are wider epistemic goals than K
            - Ex: Rationality, Wisdom
    * Theory of Epistemic Justification
        - Does two things:
            1. Gives general procedures for inquiry
            2. Set standards for ealuating productions of inquiry
        - Belief is justified if:
            * Produced by correct procedure for inquiry
            * Evluative it positivly along epistmic lines
        - NOT Anarchy..., Justification is important
    * Normative versus Descriptive
        - Descriptive Epistemology
            * Branch of Psychology/Cognitive Science
            * How do we come to believe or know?
            * What causal cirumstances/ cognitive mechanisms?
        - Normative Epistemology
            * Purely philosophical principle
            * How should we generate beliefs in regard to getting K
            * K=TB is a normative concern

- Deontological and Teleological Conceptions
    * In Ethics:
        - Deontological
            * Obligations and permission
            * Moral actions as what is done in obidience to principles
            * Serve in turn no end that could be looked on as overall moral ground
        - Teleological
            * Morally good conduces to some goal
            * I.e Utilitiarianism, Hedonism
    * Apply Deonotological  v Teleological to Epistemology
        - Deontological: permission, ideals, obligaionts
        - Teleogical: goal and end-game of epistemology for inquiry
    * Deontological Guide to Inquiry
        - Believe only whats in the bible
        - Criticism: 
            * What is the source of our epistemic obligations?
            * Reply: God, or State
        - Thus, Deontological conception of epi norms unprob 
    * Injunctive Teleological Accounts of Normative Epistemology
        - By analogy to utilitarnism 
        - Yield duties or permission that conduece to knowledge
        - Alston: presupposes doxastic volunatrism
            * Idea that Beliefs are under voluntary control
    * Evaluative/Strong Position Account (Alston)
        - Desirable to get in strong psotion to give view about:
            1. Correct procedures for inquiry
            2. Some account of evaluation
        - We don't give praise/blame to epistemic mattter
        - Some epistemic matters are simply better than others
        - Thus Alstons J is a matter of getting in a good position

- Truth Conduciveness
    * Beliefs jutified have good reason to be true
    * Bonjour: Epistemic justification is of instrumental value
    * Telos of K is Merely true belief
    * Now I will be assumed of begging the question by assuming K to be the goal of inquiry
        - What better telos is there for epistemology
    * Epistemic telos not true belief but is true belief based on adequete grounds/strong position.
    * But we can't establish what said adequeate grounds/strong position is...

- Lycan's Explanationism
    * Denies that true is overall goal of inquiry
    * Beliefs justified in virtue of expanatory role
        - Justified by choerence with previously held beliefs
        - Goes on to say all inference relies on I.B.E
        - Even in MP deduction, we are not forces to accept conclusion
            * Always can reject one of premises
    * Lycan is similar to Bonjour
        - Bonjour hjolds that we have spotenous noninffered belief with prima facie justificatoin
        - DIFFERENT:
            1. Lycan goes further toward coherence in description of explanatory cirtues
            2. Does not require Bonjour's Metajustificatory view
        - If J is necessary for K then we must take Lycans approach
            * Thus, we cannot mantain the telos of K to be true belief
        - Drawbacks of Lycan:
            * Absorbs epistemic value into sheer utility
                - Occam's razor, accept similar hypotheses, but not epistemically correct
            * We must use explantory criteria in generating beliefs
