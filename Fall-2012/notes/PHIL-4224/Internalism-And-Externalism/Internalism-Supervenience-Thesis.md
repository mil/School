Internalist Supervenience Thesis
================================
- The justifactory status of a person's doxastic attitude supervenes on the person's mental states / events/ dispositions
- Questions Want to Ask:
    1. Does the objection depend on internalism being founded on the GD conception of justification?
        * Stored Belief (Forgotten Evidence)
            - If you forget a belief/you have stored evidence unable for recall, how is the internalist justified
            - There are no obvious internal justified
                * Ex: Mom's Birthday, The Bears beat the Cowboys
                * Ex Justifier: ESPN.com showed TR looking like a sad sack under the headline "Bears Rumble to Victory"
                    - This is an unconscous thought
            - Suppose: Stick to Strong Internalism (concious/occurent)
                * --> Justification
                    -  -> Dispositional
                        * (S is disp just in belief p if S is disposed to enter a conciosu state that justified the belief that p)
                        * Fell asleep, answer written on the board
                        * You think answer is B
                    -  -> Occurent
                        * 
                        * You open your eyes and you see B on the board
            - Reply:
                * Goldman raises objection
                * Add:
                    - (S is disp just in belief p if S is **in an internal state such they tye are** disposed to enter a conciosu state that justified the belief that p)
    2. If yes to (1), Can the objection be recreated for the non-GD internalist?
    3. How might the non-GD internalist respond?
