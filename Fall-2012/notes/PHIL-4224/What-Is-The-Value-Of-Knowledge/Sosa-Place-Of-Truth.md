- Truth as the only fundamneltal epistemic value
- True Belief versus Knowledge
    * True Belief
        - Do we care about truth, as such?
        - One option: True belief as such have value.
        - Option two: If we care about wheter p, we'd perfer truth to falsity
        - How can we slide from two to one
    * How do we get from TB -> K
        - Zagzebski: Reliability
            * K=TB produced by reliable process
                - Value of TB + value reliable process
                - Reliable process adds no additional value
- Intrinsic Value versus Instrumental Value
    * Two world can differ in terms of instrumental value regardless of if they have the same intrinsic value
    * Example:
        - Universe 1:
            * X = 8 units of p
            * Y = 10 units
            * Z = 12 units
            * Total: 30 units of pleasure
            * There is a casual connection between XY&Z
            * Thus X is instrumental to Y, and Y is instrumental valuable to Z
        - Universe 2:
            * X = 8 units of p
            * Y = 10 units
            * Z = 12 units
            * Total: 30 units of pleasure
            * There is no causal connection between XY&Z

    * Instrinsic Value
    * Instrumental Value
    * Reliablism double counts the instrumental value
