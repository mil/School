2. The value of truth and a new value Gettier problem
3. Solving the new value Gettier problem


Morals of the Value Problems
----------------------------
1. Truth plus a reliable source of truth cannot explain knowledge.
    - Reliabalism has a particular diffucult time dealing with the value problem
        * Reliablism
        * Espresso Machine --> Espresso
        * Traits/Cognitive Activity --> True Belief
2. Truth plus an independently valuable source cannot explain the value of knowledge
    - If we use the machine product model, doesn't always give use results we want
        * Disconnect between product and the source
    - In order to correctly address the value problem - must abandon the machine-product model
3. Knowing is related to the knower not as product to machine but as act to agent
    - Agent --> Action
    - Agent --> True Belief
    - Reliablity is not good indpendent of reverything else
        * Nothing specially valuable about reliability
    - Something valuable about cause or source of TB does not necessarily help value of K
    - Source (intrinsicly valuable) ---- casual relation --> TB

- Connection between knower and knowledge is too weak
    * Belief is related to the knower as the product is to a machine
        - Need to tighten this connection
    * Knower -> Belief
        - Agent (Goodness or badness of motives) ---(some logical connection / not casual )--> Act (Goodness or badness of act)
    * Beliefs are motivated true beliefs become knowledge by having the right motivation
    * Love of Truth is the telos
        - K = TB from love of truth
        - Value of K = Value of TB + value of love of truth
    * Beliefs are motivated in sense that 
- Value of Love of Truth
    1. Possibility of moral praise & blame
        - Blame: 
    2. True beliefs are valuable as means to our ends
        - So love of truth is valuable as means to practical ends.

The Value of Truth and a New Value Gettier Problem
---------------------------------------------------
- Two parts of Knwoledge
    * Based in a love of truth = Admirable
    * Constituted in part by a true belief = Desirable
- New Gettier Probelm
    * Desirable & Admirable is what makes K valuable
        - Desirable:  (TB)
            * True beliefs are good/valuable in the sense of being good for you.
            * Ex: Find out wife is cheating on you <--- not desirable
                - Are desirable because -- where roanokae airport is <-- desirable , helps you achieve sucess
        - Admirable:  (J)
            * Credit ot the agent/subject
            * The A/S does something, earns their knowledge/praise/blame
            * Knowledge is worked for
    * Admirable but not desirable belief
        - Leaves on the tree
    * Lucky is admirable but not desirable
    * Most valueable is admirable and desirable
- Value Scale
    * A & D = Most Valuable
    * (A & ~D) || (~A & D) = Less Valuable
    * ~A & ~D = Least Valuable
- But What if A&D is accidental, well formed belief on important topic
    * But well formed belief on desirable topic formation is accidental

- Explaning the value of knolwedge as flowing from the credit the agent gets for the true belief
    * Zagzebski: that their TB is due to their love of the Truth
    * Agent -> Actor
    * Subject -> Belief
        - Best way to understand belief is that whatever values you accrue or create in forming belief -- can be passed on to the belief
        - When a belief is formed out of a love of truth, there is room for value of love of belief to be passed onto the belief itself
        - This is why knowledge is more valuable than true belief

- New Gettier Problem
    * If you have a Desirable Admirable Knowledge -- they may only be connected by chance
        - Non-Accidential connection of D&A type knowledge will be more valuable
        - How do we explain how V(K) in regards to D(B) + A(B) and D&B's association
    * ~D & ~A -- could be just a true belief -- ex prejudices, no good reason, etc.
    * Gettier case is Desirable and Admirable
    * Lesson of the New Gettier Problem:
        - Valuf of K is not jus tthe sum of the value of a belief in so far as it's good for you and the value of a belief, in so far as it's admirably held
        - Speicfy time the dinosaurs killed by meteor --- no practical time to scientists
            * Admirable
            * Desirable? <-- free up time
- Why D<->A > D A
    * Value of K flows, in part from its motive (love of truth)
    * Value of the motive of the love of truth from what  motivates it.
        - Pracitcal Ends
        - Living a moral life
    * Love of truth motivated by desire for certain practical ends
        - or mmaybe a corn to behave morally
        - This can be all motivated by -- desired by the good life -- eudamonia, etc....
            * At some leve eudamonia speicifies whtat beliefs are desirable
                - time dinosaurs killed not desirable beliefs
        - Collpases epistemiollgy into value theory / moral philosophy
            * Study of good life - eudamonia
