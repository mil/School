==========
- If Knowledge = JTB + X 
  * Gettier problems inescapable
  * Example:
    - Start with a Justified False Belief
    - Make element of justification strong enough for knowledge
    - Make Belief False
- What generates problem for JTB is accident of bad luck cancelled out by an accident of good luck
  * Right gol is achieved but only by chance
- Gettier
  * String together 
    - Bad Luck  (Well-Positioned Subject)
    - Good Luck (A True Belief)
  * This is enabled by Justifcation (JTB+x) where X does not entail truth
    - If you make that kind of move, you're getting rid of alot of what we traiditionally call knowledge / we are justified in
  * Either non Truth condition of K implies turth or not entails:
    * Yes: Loose lots of Knolwege/Justification
    * No: Gettier follows
