    <div id='title'>Poetry is More Useful in Attaining Wisdom than Philosophy</div>
    <p>Poetry and philosophy are both forms of literature that may be read and thus thought about. Given that thinking leads to wisdom, philosophy and poetry may both be seen as useful resources in attaining wisdom. However, which is a more useful resource in attaining wisdom: poetry or philosphy?  Forthcoming, I will illustrate how poetry can be understood as encompassing philosophy and thus a more useful resource in attaining wisdom than merely philosophy alone. My project outlined, I will now offer a brief roadmap of my argument for why poetry is a more useful resource in attaining wisdom than is philosophy.</p>
    <p>First in <b>(I)</b>, I will illustrate how both poetry and philosophy can be understood as useful resources in attaining wisdom. Next, in <b>(II)</b>, I will attempt to delineate what poetry is from what poetry is not. Following, in <b>(III)</b>, I will offer my formalized positive argument for why poetry is more useful in attaining wisdom than philosophy. Finally in <b>(IV)-(V)</b>, I will refute two potential counter-objections which may be offered against my argument explicated in <b>(III)</b>.</p>
    <h2>I. Philosophy and Poetry: Both Forms of Literature Used to Attain Wisdom</h2>
    <p>Both poetry and philosophy exist in the form of written text, or <i>literature</i>.  When reading literature, one consciously runs over the words presented in the literature in one's own mind.  Thus, literature, of which poetry and philosophy both are, when read leads one to think.  Since thinking makes you wise, literature is useful in attaining wisdom . "Thinking makes you wise" is a claim I feel fairly un-controversial with no need to be defended. However, my interlocutor might wish to dispute and allude that "ignorance is bliss!". My interlocutor might argue that thinking <i>does not</i> in fact make you wise. To this claim, I would ask my interlocutor to consider the following question: Who is more wise, the literate or the illiterate?</p>
    <p>Assuming we value the opinion of the wiser over the less wise, if my interlocutor were to claim "the illiterate is wiser than the literate", that would be analogous to my interlocutor claiming "dis-regard what I am saying since the un-spoken illiterate is wiser than I". Alternatively, even if we make no prior value judgment about whether to value higher the opinion of the wiser or the less wise, my interlocutor suggests, simply by virtue of arguing (for wisdom of the illiterate), to dis-regard their position in favor of blank space or emptiness offered by the illiterate.  As such, my claim that literature makes you think and thus is useful in attaining wisdom is adequately defended for our purposes.</p>
    <h2>II. Attempting to Define Poetry</h2>
    <p>Before I attempt to determine which is more useful in attaining wisdom, poetry or philosophy, I need to define both poetry and philosophy.  In this section, I will attempt to define poetry. If I were to successfully define poetry, I would be able to distinguish what poetry <i>is</i>, from what poetry <i>is not</i>. To start in analysis, first we need realize the word <i>poetry</i> can be understood in several senses: as a verb, as a noun, as an adjective, and so on. For our purposes, let us consider poetry strictly in the sense in which the word is a <i>noun</i>. Additionally, let us consider poetry as solely in the form of written words on paper, or as <i>literature</i> so we need not concern ourselves with what actions constitute "doing poetry" or trying to determining who is a "poet".</p>
    <p>The scope of poetry now narrowed to poetry as a noun, existing merely in literature, I will now attempt to narrow poetry's definition further by way of two separate methodologies. First, in <b>(II.<sub>I</sub>)</b>, I will attempt to define poetry by placing poetry in opposition to prose. Second, in <b>(II.<sub>II</sub>)</b>, I will attempt to define poetry by considering the concept of "forms" of poetry as a qualifying criteria for defining what poetry is. Closing this section, in <b>(II.<sub>III</sub>)</b>, I will offer remarks on the shortcomings of the two methodologies explored in <b>(II.<sub>I-II</sub>)</b> and offer a definition of poetry by utilizing Wittgenstein's concept of meaning as use.</p>
    <h2>II.<sub>I</sub> Poetry: Perhaps It's Literature That's Not Prose</h2>
    <p>One way of defining poetry is to place poetry in opposition to what poetry is not: <i>prose</i>.  Any given piece of literature can be classified as either poetry or prose, but not both. We can classify any given piece of literature as poetry or prose by determining whether the piece of literature in question resembles the natural deductive flow of language <i>or</i> is more concerned with rhythm, rhyme, and aesthetic qualities. Thus, we should note it seems that the goals of poetry and prose run contrary to each other.</p>
    <p>Prose, emphasizes a direct and natural deductive flow of language, leading its reader to a single interpretation.  In reading prose, one consciously observes how language follows. It can be easily understood how words build into sentences, facilitating a greater composition or <i>meaning</i>. Most of what we find in science textbooks, philosophical works, and the like is prose.  Prose, posing one distinct meaning, uses language exclusively in its most descriptive, concrete manner. Prose's resulting message appears valid, deductive, clear, and succinct.  Poetry, however, focuses on aesthetic qualities, rhythm, and rhyme leading its reader to multiple interpretations.  Poetry, intentionally has its goal set in multiple meanings by manipulating language, placing positive value on aesthetics.  Poetry concedes language cannot succinctly convey one message and as such invites multiple meanings to the table. Consider for example, this piece of poetry: "Spectator snorts bacon the ridden village". It is unclear what the speaker is trying to convey beyond the aesthetics of the language. Although there might be some deeper message, the language is presented in such a way it is unclear just what the message precisely is. In other words, poetry leads itself to multiple meanings due to the aesthetic play on language conveyed by the writer.</p>
    <p>Now our question becomes: what is the hard set way to distinguish or label one piece of literature as prose or poetry? Maybe, to distinguish prose from poetry the reader need just ask: is the author trying to convey a single clear message or could the literature be taken in several different ways? We could call the former poetry, and the latter prose.  Unfortunately, the poetry-prose line is not quite this clear cut because such inquiry is not criteria, but mere refutable question. Consider a seemingly direct piece of literature such as "the sky is blue". This statement has a very direct feel and we intuitively want to call this statement prose. However, in order to decipher the meaning of this statement, we need consider what our conceptions of the words "the", "sky", "is", and "blue" mean. If any two individuals have different conceptions of any of what any of those words mean, then multiple meanings are possible. So is "the sky is blue", prose or poetry? One could argue its prose and another could argue its poetry. As such, for now we must concede that distinguishing prose from poetry is fallible. As such, the prose-poetry distinction is not a helpful criteria in grokking at or moving closer towards the meaning of poetry.</p>
    <h2>II.<sub>II</sub>. Poetry: Perhaps It's The Literature Fitting to Poetic Form</h2>
    <p>The prose-poetry distinction fallible, an alternative to defining poetry is to consider the concept of "forms" of poetry.  Perhaps, we could say if a given piece of literature could be classified in at least one poetic form, it is poetry. Contrarily , if given piece of literature cannot be classified into at least one poetic form, it is not poetry.  Following this line of reasoning, poems are categorized into "forms" by adherence to specific sets of rules indicative of rhythm, meter, and other aesthetic qualities.  For example, if a poem is 3 lines, 17 syllables, and a pattern of 5-7-5 syllables per line then the poem can be called a "haiku". Forms vary widely from having strict hard set rules (such as is the case with ghazals, sonnets, and hakius) to having very loose and un-specific rules.</p>
    <p>On the spectrum of forms with loose and un-specific rules exist the "free-verse" and "prose-poetry" forms. Free-verse poetry serves as an overarching form to classify poems that do not fit into any other forms. In other words, a free-verse poem has <i>no</i> rules. Unlike other forms of poetry, to be classified as a free-verse poem, a piece of literature need not follow any specify rhythm, meter, or any other aesthetic "poetic" patterns. As such, a free-verse poem is simply any given piece of literature to which someone has applied the label: free-verse. Another form of poetry with loose and un-specific rules is "prose-poetry" form. Prose-poetry is considered to be a mixture of prose and poetry. Again as is the case with free-verse poems, the only thing that defines a poem of this form is that the poem is labeled as prose-poetry.  Prose-poetry hints again at the absurdity of trying to delineate between poetry and prose as shown fallible in <b>(II.<sub>I</sub>)</b>.  Given such leniency of free-verse and prose-poetry forms, it seems that defining literature as poetry if any given piece of literature fits into a poetic form is just as fallible as distinguishing between prose and poetry.</p>
    <h2>II.<sub>III</sub>. Poetry: It's Just Meaning as Use</h2>
    <p>As explored in <b>(II.<sub>I</sub>)</b> and <b>(II.<sub>II</sub>)</b>, trying to define poetry in opposition to prose and trying to categorize literature as poetry if it fits into poetic forms both are fallible methodologies. It seems as if poetry is beyond hard, set, fast definition. Perhaps it is not by specific criteria by which poetry is defined, but rather poetry is defined more abstractly, merely in reference to what is "labeled" as <i>poetry</i>.</p>
    <p>Such reasoning is example of Wittgenstein's concept of "meaning as use". I began my exploration by trying and failing to find a definition or meaning of the term poetry. By embarking on such exploration, I held implicit the assumption that there could be a descriptive or analytic criteria by which I could classify literature as "poetry" or "not poetry".  However, it is more likely the case that over years, the meaning of the word poetry has been shaped and melded, not by set descriptive criteria, but rather by the ways in which the word poetry has been used.  In Wittgenstein's words, "for a large class of cases though not for all -- in which we employ the word 'meaning' it can be defined thus: the meaning of a word is its use in the language" (PI 43).  I do not want to concede that a descriptive definition of poetry such that we could determine what is "poetry" and what is "not poetry" is impossible. However, for the purposes of my project forthworth, I will consider that the word "poetry" need best be understood in terms with Wittgenstein's concept of "meaning as use". As such, poetry is whatever people call poetry (Biletzki, Anat, and Matar, 2011).</p>
    <h2>III. Central Argument: Poetry is More Useful in Attaining Wisdom than Philosophy</h2>
    <p>Established now that literature, of which poetry and philosophy are both forms of, is useful in attaining wisdom <b>(I)</b> and additionally clarified that poetry's meaning lies in its use <b>(II)</b>, I will now introduce my central argument:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Literature is useful in attaining wisdom.</li>
      <li>Poetry and philosophy are both forms of literature.</li>
      <li>Poetry's meaning lies in its use.</li>
      <li>Everything we call philosophy, I can categorize (as a subset, or form) of poetry.</li>
      <li><i>(From 4):</i> Poetry is larger and greater than philosophy.</li>
      <li><i>Thus:</i> Poetry is a more useful in attaining wisdom than philosophy.</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>IV. Objection Against 4: Philosophy is not Poetry</h2>
    <p>One might offer a counter-objection to my <b>(4)</b>, questioning whether philosophy should be absorbed by or classified as poetry.  To this objection, I would concede that my argument is in indeed a normative claim and not a descriptive claim. I am not arguing that philosophy <i>is</i> just a subset of poetry. Rather, I am claiming that philosophy <i>should be</i> viewed as just a subset of poetry (assuming, your goal is seeking wisdom). Further, I would point my objector to my understanding of poetry in reference to poetry being defined as how it is used <b>(II.<sub>III</sub>)</b>.</p>
    <p>Regardless of my poetry as use definition, my objector might contest that philosophy is uniquely distinct from poetry, or even stronger simply point out that my conception of "poetry" makes "everything poetry". To this point, I would smile and note: that's the point. The fact that we can't distinguish what is poetry from what is not poetry highlights something unique about how we should view literature and language in relation to poetry.</p>
    <p>Poetry runs through everything in language. There is always rhythm and rhyme in language words. Acquainted alliterations and allusions, intentional or not, occur more often than not. The sooner you realize the nature of all language to be understood as poetry, the sooner you can use language poetically to your advantage. Such omnipresent nature as is seen with poetry, I believe is not as true of philosophy in language. Philosophy, without exhaustive definition, is about reason and deduction. Reason and deduction is one part of language but it does not run through all language.</p>
    <p>My objector, now might argue why does poetry have to encompass philosophy or philosophy have to encompass poetry? Can't both stand independent of one another? To this, I would point out that I have a teleological goal here, attaining wisdom.  Further, if a young scholar were to ask me: which is a more useful in attaining wisdom: poetry or philosophy? I need say poetry, because poetry can be understood as everything philosophy is and more. I do not know of a whole lot of people who call themselves poets who would offer refutation to such claim.  Offering deductive criticisms and refutations isn't poets' modus operandi.  Contrarily, philosophers, who love to argue, would surely offer argumentation against me if I were to claim that "philosophy is everything". Why? Philosophy's culture is rooted in precision, rationality, and arguments. Contrarily, poetry's culture is filled with ambiguity, broadness, and acceptingness. I believe then if you set your teleological goal to attaining wisdom, you should prefer and find more useful the friendlier option, poetry, which gives you broadness and acceptingness over rationality and arguments. I need not defend this argument any further, for you see, I am not a fan of argument. I am a philosopher, but more broadly, a poet.</p>
    <h2>V. Objection Against 1: More Literature Does Not Lead to More Wisdom</h2>
    <p>One might deny my <b>(1)</b> and argue that more literature does not lead to more wisdom. To this objection, I would point back to my wquestion raised in <b>(I)</b>... who is more wise: the literate or the illiterate? Additionally, reposed questions might include: why do people go to school? why do people educate themselves? why do people learn? and why do people communicate?</p>
    <p>An objection against <b>(1)</b> is to suggest an alternative model of what wisdom is. Such a model I would be incredibly interested in hearing about. I actively welcome ideas such as the illiterate being more wise than the literate. In fact, in many ways I whole-heartedly agree with such notions. However, I also think somebody holding such belief would have little interest in reading this piece of philosophy. Further, they would have even smaller interest in offering some formal philosophical argument for backing their claim. Rather, perhaps they'd read to me some poetry and bestow their wisdom upon me.</p>
