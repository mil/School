    #title Bridging the Gap between Programming and Computiner
   
    
    %p I cringe when I hear someone claim in earnest,  "I am not programmer". My distaste does not stem from my own self-identification as a programmer (among other things), but rather a larger cultural mis-understanding of the gap in the analgoy between computing and programming. What I refer to an overly narrow understanding of the capabilities of us all in an age in which we are immersed in a world of computing. A maxim of my argument would not be understood as "we should all be programmers", but rather "we already all are programmers".  Why I say we already all are programmers is that I see a substantially smaller distance between the analagous of programming and computing 
    
    I simply wish to demystify and provide conceptual ground for understanding programming  in relation to computing. A normative claim, I believe we place far too much boundary between computing and programming. I hope to show a sense of close analogy between programming and computing to my readers such that either one could be seen as interchangable.


    %h2 Forms of Life: Understanding, Making, and Using Technologies: 
    %p We ought understand technology, the larger construct computing is subsumed beneath, in order to grasp the relation between computing and programming. So, what is technology? A common sense approach would suggest to us that technology is a set of <i>tools</i> or <i>means</i> which assist us in accomplishing some <i>goals</i> or <i>ends</i>. For example, if I have the goal of opening a bottle of beer, I might accomplish this goal by utilizing the technology, or mean, of a bottle opener to remove the cap from the bottle. However, I need now mention, technology viewed in the manner of as a <i>tool</i> or <i>means</i> is to be taken in the broadest sense possible.  Rendering technology as tools should encompass not only physical tools, but additionally tools of social or mental construct. Joseph Pitt, in his book <i>Thinking About Technology</i> elaborates on this notion by asseriting that historically technology "has been characterized only as mechanical tools", going on to state that this is a flawed conception of technlogy, as technology is also inclusive of "social phenonmena". Pitt's intent is to highlight that in a similar way in which we use physical tools to accomplish physical ends, we may use social tools to accomplish social ends. For instance, "governments, organizations, and hierarchies" are tools and technology much in the same way physical tools are technologies. 

    %p Understanding technology as tools is a start, however, our cenception need be widened from being simply technology being synonmous with "tools". The reason for extending technonology in scope is that technology encompasses not only technical artifacts (social and physical tools) that make up the "means" of our world, but also includes the social contexts, or worlds, in which those artifacts are designed and employed. As such, we find to philosophically pose the question "what is technology?" is to conflate two issues: 1) "what 'things' are technology?" and 2) "how do we make and use these 'things' of technology?". To address the second question, really we are seeking to determine how the word "technology" functions as a <i>verb</i>, or alternativly, what is the nature of technological progresses?  Approaching the second question, a pivot from the descriptive project of asking "how" to seeking to understand: what is the <i>realtionship</i> between making and the use of technologies?  Prima facie, it appears, the relation between the making and use of technology is minimal or non-existant. For example, I don't know how my car was constructed, but I know how to drive it.  I don't know how to chop, cut, and craft a tree into a collection of pencils, but I can write with one.  In abstracto, the "making" and "use" of technologies are seemingly separate social processes with unrelated social contexts.  
    
    %p Langdon Winner in "Technologies as Forms of Life", elaborates on this phenomena of "use" being separate from "making" in explicating that humans in "mode of use" view technologies simplistically; having "little interest in or need to know about the materials, principles, or procedures" needed to create the technology in question. Extending on the isolation of "use", he claims viewing technology-as-a-tool understands technologies with ambivalence in regards to "ethical" qualities. He mentions he can use a knife to "slice a loaf of bread or to stab the next person that walks by" and that technologies can be used "well or poorly and for good or bad purposes". His point is that technologies in "use" seem more or less "neutral in regard of their moral standing" (105).  Later in the article, Winner parallels his infamous "Do Artifacts Have Politics?" in an appeal to pay attention to "the kind of world are we making?" (112). Borrowing Wittgenstein's concept of "forms of life", Winner explicates that technologies bring with them "worlds" and we ought be concerned with the kinds of worlds we are both participating in and creating. He provides numerous ancetodes to buttress his claim and argues at base level that as much as we shape technology; it shapes us. One example Winner provides is that of parents needing to keep their children attended to. 
    
    
    that technological artifacts bring with them social contexts. Technological arifacts embody <i>worlds</i> of their own in which we participate. 
 
    This intuition makes a lot of sense, as often we use technologies simply in the technology-as-tools manner. I don't need to know what type of metal my cork-screw is composed of, how the mold was formed, or other questions of "creation" to know how to use the cork-screw to remove a cork from my wine bottle.. 

their relation holds the key for understanding technology as it relates to computing. 
    
    %p I will now argue with support from Winner, that viewing technology merely as a tool is the source of ambivalence 


    
    Invetors create technologies and then the technologies are "used" as tools. Is there cross-over in production and use of technologies? Langdon Winner in his "" addresses this concern in explaining that making or creation is "the domain of investors, technicians, engineers, repeairmen, and the like.... those not directly involves in the various speheres of "making" are thought to have little intrestes in or need to know about... those spheres". Winner goes on to explain that 
    
    the two processes are in practice intricately related. Langdon Winner adds support to this thesis in , in which he argues that understanding the relation between making and use is fundamental to understanding technology. Furthermore he asserts that the notion of technology merely a tool, " needs to be overcome if a critical philosphy of technology is to move ahead" (105). Winner argues in his article that technologies bring with them their own "worlds"

would seek we need appopriate an conceptualization of the way in which technology is employed in the world. 
    
    Technologies, understood as simply tools, help us to accomplish end-goals. They are means, in the widest sense possible.

    %p Up to this point I have been refering to technology as a noun, but of more 

    %p Understanding technology as tools allows us to open up two forms of questions about the nature of technology: 1) questiong concerning the creation of tools and 2) questions concerning the use of tools. 
    
    However, this understanding of technology is overly-simplified in that construes technology as limited to things in the physical sense. Technology goes beyond the physical sense in that, governements, social organizations, and communities can all be viewed as technologies as well. Similar to sense in which technologies, technology in the metnal sense are 
    
    However, understanding technologies as merely tools is likely to narrow of a sense in which to take technology as it is often the case that technologies are generative. 

    often understand technology as an useful device to help us accomplish goals. As such, technologies are often understood as <i>tools</i> or <i>means</i>, in accomplishing some <i>goal</i> or <i>end</i>. For example, if you have a nail that you want to 
    
    accomplishing goals we set out. As such, technologies serve the purpose of means to which some 
    %p Technological Functionalism is my label for a view of <i>technologies as tools</i> or technologies as mere means for accomplishing some purpose. Tools, being things things we <i>make</i>, we subsequently employ in <i>use</i> for some desired purpose.  This conception of technologies as synonymous with tools, philosophical technological concerns may be separated into two distinct categories: making (of tools) and their (tools) further use. By this view tools are ethically impartial, taking on moral significance only when put to use by some social actor. My view Technological Functionalism is adapted from Langdon Winner in "Technologies as Forms of Life" in which he explains, "I can use my knife to slice a loaf of bread or to stab the next person that walks by".  Winner articulates viewing technology as tools, problems separated into categories of the making of and use, is a "conventional idea" that needs be "overcome if a critical philosophy of technology is to move ahead". 
    %p The problem with the notion of Technological Functionalism, is that actions of making tools and the use of tools are intricately associated, often mutually inspiring one another. Societal concerns in the use of technologies inspire adaptations, variations, and transformations in demanding new technologies; while new technologies give birth again to new societal concerns of the same nature. The that view society is propelled by concerns technology <i>generates</i>, or the view that "technical innovation is the basic cause of changes in society" is called in the field "technological determinism" (107).  Winner and I would both agree "determinism" is too strong a label for grokking the process of technology as it downplays choice in the process of technological progress.
    %p

    %p Rather than understanding technology as composed of diseprate issues of making and use, or as a self-propelled deterministic process, I suggest that we view technology as a 
    %p If not Technological Determinism, then how should we understand technological progress. we understand technology

    is that he believes that the "making" and "use" of technologies are not disseprate but intricately tied to one another such that technologies "reshape" human activity and meaning. Technologies transform the way people go about life, what we call "mere technological entities" he says are "broadly.. involved in conditions of social and moral life". 

We carefully set out to design technologies and subsequently use said technologies, as tools in everyday practical situations of <i>use</i>. 

    %p Challenging acceptance of Technological Functionalism is at the root of the problem I wish to address. My main concern is that Technological Functionalism leads us, culturally, to view technology in an overly narrow sense.
