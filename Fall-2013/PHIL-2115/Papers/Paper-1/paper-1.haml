    #title Ancient Philosophy Required the Deontological Practice of Questioning 
    %p To fully develop a response to the question "what is ancient philosophy" is a much larger project than could be undertaken in the provided word limit. As such, in this paper I will merely use ancient philosophy texts to argue that: one necessary condition for doing philosophy is asking questions (<b>AQ</b>).  As such, following in order to support <b>AQ</b>, firstly in (I) I will explain the difference between necessary and sufficient conditions, next in (II) I will show how several ancience greek philosophers can be identified as supporting <b>AQ</b>, finally in (III) I will refute potential counter-argumentation denying <b>AQ</b>.

    %h2 I. The Difference Between Necessarya and Sufficient Conditions
    %p Before I illustrate how several ancient greek philosophers can be seen to support <b>AQ</b>, I first must explain the difference between necessary and sufficient conditions in relation to <b>AQ</b>. <b>AQ</b> states that <i>one</i> necessary condtion for the practice of philosophy is asking questions, What it means for asking questions to be <i>nescssary</i> to the practice of philosophy is that <i>if and only if(iff)</i> questions are asked what the practice of philosophy carried out. Thus, put another way, philosophy <i>requires</i> asking questions. Contary to <i>necessary</i> conditions, if you were to rerender <b>AQ</b> such that asking questions was only one sufficient condition of doing philosophy, then somebody <i>if</i> they had asked questions could be said to have engaged in the philosophical processes, however it would not be required of the process. As such, asking questions would be just one sufficient condijtion of the philosophical process, among which other sufficient condtions, such as looking up at the sky and scratching one's chin would also be included.

    %p With the distinction between necessary and sufficient condtiions for doing philosophy made clear, it should be apparent what I am arguing. It is necssary to the philosophical process to ask questions. The reason I argue this is that asking questions is the start of any philosophical process.

    %h2 II. Ancient Greek Philosophers Lend Support to <b>AQ</b>


    %h2 I. The Deontolotical Practice of Asking Questions
    %p Two types project can be distinguished bnetwee. A teloelogical project should seek very generally to undertstand the ultimate goals of 
    (2) have its teloeological methodology rooted in asking questions. With the premises (1) and (2) established, I will 
    %p Could I convince you in the scope of this paper of what ancient philosophy is? Or in other words, could I make you believe that ancient philosophy was one thing?

    Firstly in (I), I will clarify the difference between deontology and teleology, next, in (II), I will identify two dist inict practices that ancient greek philsophers were engaged in, and finally concluding in (III). 

    %p The prompt asks for identification of a feature or set of features of ancient philosophy. One feature that is characteristic of ancient philosophy is the belief that asking another question is wise. 
    
    What ancient philosophy is it is asked that we identify a feature or set of features that define acient philosophy

    %p In order to ask a question you must be able to determine the difference between the good and the bad. But even you need ask the question indepenently of thing x, is thing x good?

    #title Concerning the Role of Philosophy
    %p If one were to pose the question, "What is ancient philosophy?", if you peel off ancient modifier, you'll arrive at the question "what is philosophy?".  So perhaps a defintion of philosophy would shed light on the question of what is philosophy. A common defintion ties philosophy to a concept called <i>wisdom</i>. For example, Merriam Webster's dictionary defines philosophy as "love an persuit of wisdom by intellectual means and moral self-discpline". The quintessential word in the definition is <i>wisdom</i>.
    %p What about the practice of philosophy gets at the goal of wisdom though.  Plato, often recognized as one of the first philosophers, asserted that it was not what was <i>knows</i> that is the focal practice to being wise, but rather, it was one will admit he does not know. Consider the following quote from Plato in which he explains why he was wiser than a politician: "It's likely that neither of us knows anything fine and good, but he thinks he kmnows something he doesn't know, whereas I, since I don't in fact know, don't think that I do either. At any rate it seems that I'm wiser than he in just this one small way: that what I don't know, I don't think I know". 
    %p But what is this speak of an epistemological subject? One that questions, an epistemological subject, could willingly ask the question -- who am I? To ask this question however is to bring in the implications of language into our discoruse, at which point you must ask yourself as a subject, who is this.

    
    ? If so Plato, by admitting to himself how little he knew, or in other words, being a philosopher willing to ask another question, to which there are always more questions knew what they knew.
    %h2 Philosophers Can Always Ask More Questions
    %h2 Even when there is no clear answer. 
    %h2  
      
    %p To make the problematic implications of the question of "what exists" clear, to start with I will highlight a quote from the ancient greek philosopher, Zeno of Ela. "Zeno stated that if anyone could make clear to him what the one is, he would be able to speak of the things that are" (Zeno of Ela, 49). From this quote, it seems vague as to what "one" Zeno is referring, however this ambiguity highlights the point Zeno was trying to make:  any given subject could never know what they are because what they are is all they are. Thus the problem stated plainly is: how can one understand existance at any given time from within in existence. Given that we exist, it is diffucult to understand what exists because we cannot know of what does not exists.

    %p Its not that what exists is a rhetorical question, however, rather it is like much of philosophical inquiry. Philosophy is a conversation which seeks to understand the mechanisms of the language we use. In philosophy, all questions are permitted because philosophy is the questioning nature of language. If science for us provided the <i>how</i> of things work, senses provided the <i>what</i>, philsophy's goal would be to understand the <i>why</i> of how things work.
    
    now a personal endaevor. Part of what m
    
    Attempts to <i>answer</i> to this question are recurrent not only to the practice of acnient greek philosophy, but in philosophy as a whole to this day in the field of metaphysics.  Alas, an <i>answer</i> the question of what exists is not easy to pinpoint. As such, in the scope of this paper, I will not attempt to provide an answer to this question, but rather merely illustrate what makes this question so hard to answer from a philosophical perspective and additionally I will provide argumentation for how one can dismiss the question of what exists from a pragmatic standpoint. Following, in (I), I will explain initial intuitions to answer the question "what exists" fail <i>prima facie</i>, next in (II), I will highlight how several ancient greek philosophers (such as Zeno of Ela, Plato, and Aristotle) attempted to handle the question of what exists, finally in (III) I will illustrate why the metaphysical question of what exists hold no weight in pragmatic discourse.
    %p Maybe, however, an answer to the question of what exists is simpler than it seems. Hericlitus said that "for many, in fact all that come upon them, do not understand such things, nor when they have noticed them do they know them, but they seem ot themselves".
    How would we construct a criteria for determining what exists (and by implication, what does not exist)?

    groundThus, we find in order to understand what exists: we would be need be able to answer the question of what does not exists.
