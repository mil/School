    #title Asking Question Was Necessary In the Ancient Philosophical Tradition 
    %p To fully develop a response to the broad question "what is ancient philosophy?" is much too large a project to be undertaken in the provided word limit. As such, rather than attempting to answer the question "what is ancient philosophy?", I will argue in support of own related thesis <b>AQ</b>: asking questions was the starting point for reasoning in the ancient philosophical tradition. <b>AQ</b> is not as broad reaching as would be a thesis attempting to answer "what is ancient philosophy", however <b>AQ</b>'s more smaller, more modest scope will be able to be developed fully within the word limit.  Following, in order to defend <b>AQ</b>, firstly in (I), I will outline one assumption AQ rests upon, treating philosophical practice as a philosophical conversation. Next in (II) and (III),  I will add support for <b>AQ</b> by examing philosophical reasoning exhibited by Plato and Zeno of Ela. Following in (IV), I will present one potentional counter-argument against <b>AQ</b>. Finally, concluding in (V), I will offer some closing remarks on the scope AQ.

    %h2 I. AQ's Bare Assumption: Philosophical Practice is a Conversation
    %p To either, grant or deny <b>AQ</b>, one must first accept one assumption that <b>AQ</b> requires: Philosophical practice is the act of engaging in philosophical conversation (internally in one's own head, by writing down thought, or by conversing with others). Philosophical practice is nothing we cannot transcribe and when we refer to philosophical practice we need be talking of the conversation of philosophy that takes place from one to oneself, or from one to another.  
    %p With this assumption established, it is also critical that I specify that the <b>ancient philosophical tradition</b> referenced in <b>AQ</b> refers to the ancient philosophical practices of, however not limtited to: Socrates, Aristotle, Zeno of Ela, Plato. With these clarifications made, if we accept this assumption that philosophical practice is the act of enganging in philosophical conversation, the philosophical conversation must start somewhere. <b>AQ</b> simply suggests that the starting place for acient philosophical conversation was asking questions.

    %h2 II. Plato's Naivete Sense of Wisdom lends support to AQ
    %p Plato argued that being a philosopher required a naivete-sense of wisdom. This naivete-sense of wisdom suggested that the philosopher be <i>truthful</i> with themselves at all times in admitting what they know and what they do not know. To be wise, Plato argued, is to have a sense of honesty with the self. In an encounter with a politician Plato recounts, Plato claims himself to be wiser than the politician not because of what he knew but what he was willing to admit he did not know. Plato admits "It's likely that neither neither of us knows anything fine and good", but he goes on to state that "I'm wiser than he in...one small way: that what I don't know, I don't think I know" (<i>Apology</i> &para;21D).
    %p What enabled Plato to state "what I don't know, I don't think I know", was his asking of the question (implicitly or explicitly) "what do I know?". Without asking the question, "what do I know?", how could Plato have formed the belief, that 'what I don't know, I don't think I know'. In other words, how may one reason about what one knows, without asking what one knows? As such, Plato's naivete sense of wisdom is brought forth through asking the question "what do I know?". Later, after the question is asked in Plato's philosophical practice, he is able to later state "what I don't know, I don't think I know" beacuse he'd asked the question, "what do I know?".  Thus, Plato's naivete sense of wisdom is simply one side-effect of accepting philosophy as a conversation and accepting <b>AQ</b>.
    %h2 III. Support from Zeno of Elea for AQ
    %p Zeno of Elea similarly to Plato, required asking questions as the starting point of his philosophical practice. In Zeno's philosophical practice he states "if anyone could make clear.. what the one is, he would be able to speak of the things that are" (<i>Zeno of Elea</i> &para;2). Here again, like in the example with Plato, if we attempt to determine the question Zeno of Ela needed to have asked in philosophical conversation to arrive at reasoning about asking about "who would be able to say what the one is", as a pre-requistive, Zeno must have asked "what is the one?". Backtracking philosophical conversation as I have done here and in the previous example seems to simply and logically follow and further it would be hard to understand how else philosophical conversation could have come about without such reasoning.
    %p In addition to this kind of backtracking approach I have taken in the previous two examples to show <b>AQ</b>, Zeno of Elea can also be seen explicityly asking questions as the start of the philosophical process. For example, Zeno explicitly asks the question "if place exists, where is it?" (<i>Zeno of Elea</i> &para;12). Later, Zeno expands this philosophical conversation to derive "for everything that exists is in a place. Therefore, place exists, then place is in a place." (<i>Zeno of Elea</i> &para;12) These more explicit questions supportive of <b>AQ</b> can be seen sprinkled throughout many both ancient and modern philosophical texts. Implicitaly, or explicitally the start of the philosophical conversation always seems to be asking questions. At a more meta-level, even this philosophy paper, which is an example of philosophical practice and thus a philosophical conversation can be seen adhering to asking questions. In order for me to have argued in favor of <b>AQ</b>, first I needed to ask the quesiton: what was the starting point for asking philosophical questions in the ancient philosophical tradition?
    %h2 IV. Counter-Argument: AQ is not supported by implicit examples in (II) and (III)
    %p There may be a potential objection to my positive support of AQ in (II) and (III) suggesting that since I implied Plato and Zeno of Elea to ask questions in starting the philosophical conversation where I did not actually provided textual reference, I am guilty of falaciously begging the question to support AQ. As such, it is not necessarily the case that questions were asked and the philosophical conversation may have begun elsewhere and not by asking questions as <b>AQ</b> suggests. 
    %p I think counter-argument holds weight, however I pose the question: if questions are not the start of the philosophical conversation, how does philosophical converstion start? If there is a more reasonable way for philosophical conversation to initiate I am open to hearing such criticism and adequetly modifying <b>AQ</b>. However, it would seem difficult still, if not impossible, to give a descriptive account of where philosophical conversation starts seperate from a normative account of where philosophical conversation <i>ought</i> to start. As such, in light of this counter-argument, <b>AQ</b> still holds weight.
