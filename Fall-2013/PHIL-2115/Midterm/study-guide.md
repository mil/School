    * The Six Principles
        - P1. Commanality 
            * What it is to have a red thing is to have that thing resemble, share, 
            * imitate, all particulars are what they are because they have in particular ..**the form**
        - P2. Seperation 
            * Metaphysically speaking, the particulars are different from their forms. Form of F is distinct from all things that are F.
        - P3. Self-Preidcation
            * Form's predicate themselves
        - P4. Purity
            * Form of F is nothing but F.

            * Only the form of redness is _actually_ red.
        - P6. Sublimity: 
            * Forms are everlasting, thye have no parts and undergo no change, 
            * and they are not perceptible to the senses.

        - That you are either going to have to give up the 
            * Principle of Sublimity or the Principle of Seperation
        - Example: 
            * Particular part of the sail is over the sailor, is that part of the form or is it the whole form. w
            * Socrates says that it is a part of the form. If sail falls down. 
            * When I share in the form of being human am I sharing a part of the form of being human or in the whole form of being human.

        - What happens is that the form wasn't there before 
        - And it gets added and similarily the privatioon of (lack of form -- musical) goes away.
    * Aristotle arguews:
        - Is the old form lost and the new form gained.
        - Accordign to Plato's Theory of the forms the forms are unique and non comparable against one another
        - As such it would seem that 
    * Plato would Respond:
