- 1. How does Georgias defened Helen of Troy?
    * Georgias defence of Helen of Troy.. Gerogias makes an intial basic distinction: She did it willingly or unwillingly. Helen is the one that ran off with paris by lover. This set off the trojan war. Helen fled to Troy with her lover paris, and her husband got pissed about that.
    * She was faded to leave troy --> was by the gods, not her fault
    * If she was forced then, ... not the fault of the once who was persuaded but rather the one that did the persuasion.
    * ((unlike incantacious spells))
    * That's what you need to respond factually.. then you need to state whether this was a persuasive argument.
((Georgias doesn't really care))
,, one argument: He's engaging in aristics and not dialectics, does not care about the truth. Taking on what is a hard defense for the challenge/fun of it. .... does this impact his credibility.  
    * -- never morally pulpable of being persuaded by arguments
- 4. Explain one of Zeno's Paradoxes
- 5. Explain the Part-Whole Objection 
    * The Six Principles
        - P1. Commanality 
            * What it is to have a red thing is to have that thing resemble, share, 
            * imitate, all particulars are what they are because they have in particular ..**the form**
        - P2. Seperation 
            * Metaphysically speaking, the particulars are different from their forms. Form of F is distinct from all things that are F.
        - P3. Self-Preidcation
            * Form's predicate themselves
        - P4. Purity
            * Form of F is nothing but F. 
            * Ex. Redness is only redness. Form of Redness is nothing but redness. 
            * What it is to be beutifal is not what it is to be just. Distinguishing between forms.
        - P5. Uniqueness:  
            * Nothing but the Form of F is really, truly, altogether F. 
            * Only the form of redness is _actually_ red.
        - P6. Sublimity: 
            * Forms are everlasting, thye have no parts and undergo no change, 
            * and they are not perceptible to the senses.
    * Part-Whole Objection 
        - That you are either going to have to give up the 
            * Principle of Sublimity or the Principle of Seperation
        - Example: 
            * Particular part of the sail is over the sailor, is that part of the form or is it the whole form. w
            * Socrates says that it is a part of the form. If sail falls down. 
            * When I share in the form of being human am I sharing a part of the form of being human or in the whole form of being human. 
            * If a part --- give the principle of sublimity. If a whole -- gotta give up the principle of seperation
- 6. The Third Man Argument
    * An objection to Plato's Theory of the Forms
    * If you have three large things and all have the form of largeness, then the form of largness is also large,
    * New Set of large things
    * Follow an infinite regresses
    * People in this classroom are the form of students, then lump that form of students in with all particular sutents, then you have a new set, some word apply to that set that makes them all common.. put all together as instances of students --> new form
    * "Uniqueness cannot be sustained if commanality is true"
- 7. Explain challenge of relational predicates to Plato's Theory of the forms. You may not appeal to the examples of master and slave discussed in lecture;  generate your own examples to illustate the problem clearly., Do you think this is a devasting objection? Why or why not?
    * Cannot concieve of a master indepent of a slave.
    * Father Son Mother Child
    * Horse/Horseman, relational predicates can't  define one without defining the other
    * Problem with relational predicates <-- what amkes a salve a slave, 
       - Is there master the form of mastery or form of mastery or a particular master
    * Plato respond that by principle of commonality, slave is a slave because it shares in the form of slavery, but is a slave a 
    * Resolution: Weigh whether or not this is a devastaing objection
    * Predication in relation to self vs. predication in relation to others
    * Form of slavery is to have part of it to have particular slaves
    * Want answer to be phrased in respect to self and then in respect to others
    * Relationship between forms, relations between particlars, 
        - but pricniple of commanilty does not tell you how to relate forms between different particulars
- 8. Aristotle Objections to Plato's Theory of the Forms.
    * Arguments 6-10 against Plato's Forms 
    * 8. Forms are useless, because they fulfill their causal role neither form an ontological nor from an epistemological point of view.
        - Can't assume that Artistotle get the higher este alos distinctoin
        - Works under the 6 principles.
        - Ontolotical - How thing is this world are
        - Epistmeological - How we actually come to know
        - He thinks this because of the pricniple of seperation.. how may they be distinct.
        - Even if we accepted the ontological story -- then it still doesn't explain how we humans come to know this relation between the forms.
    * 9. Seperation of Forms is incompatible with their role as essences and as causes of genreation and being.
        - no actual interaction between realm of the form and the realm of the particulars
        - imitating, patterns/ recipies, aristotle accepts think that forms as patterns
        - leaves unexplained the relation of the particular to their patterns.
        - who does the cutting of the fabric, who makes the cookie cutters?
- 9. How is change possible according to Artistotle?
    * The theory of four causes
        - formal -  footprint/ pattern
        - material - what its made of
        - efficient - the labor put in , the way we think about causes
        - final - what its for, what its made for
    *  there's an underlying object and two contraries, one of the contraries is the privation and one is the form. musical is the form and privation is not music. aristotle can explain contituity. what the same against two states of affairs. ideal that your a new person in each instance. 
    * aristotle wants to expalin why it is socrates, one day unmusical and then he was musical. there is this underlying susbtance the man, the man of socrates, and there is the form that gets applied to that substance (musical) form,,, what happens is that the form wasn't there before and it gets added and similarily the privatioon of (lack of form -- musical) goes away.
    * in order to explain that, change can happen from any of the foru causes.
    * since any of these things can be the sight of the cuase, and ther eis the persisting subject. 
    * aristotle's interpreation of the form is narrower
    * make a bed out of a tree,

- Parmidees argue that being is speherical
    * being is complete and wants to think what a complete shape would be -- a sphere
    * he doesn't think that being is unlimited, being has a shape, ebcause he ahd previous argued that being is complete.
    * nothing that you added to being, being is complete
    * must have a boundary and that boundary myst be a sphere

- 3 characteristics




- Hylomorphism
    * Ordinatry objects are composed of matter and form
- Monist
    * Believes either than one thing exists or that one thing exists
    * Parmides is a monist,,, doesn't break that down into particular elements
- Elementalists
    * A particular element is the fundamental elementalists of existence.
    * Fire is the fundamental ingrediaennt of all existence.
- Atomist
    * Matte ris not infinitly divisible. There is something that is fundamentally uncuttable.
    * Why they think theie right, that matter is infinitly divisible
        - if you could divide things ifinitly, you could make an infinitly small
        - if you add thing together how could they be added to have an infinite mass
        - have to have way to compose things
        - infinitly small masses
- Pluralists
    * There are multiple things in the world
    * Air, fire, earth, and water
