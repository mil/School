- **Meno Paradox, a.k.a. "the debater's argument"**
    * The Meno's paradox arises out an attempt to define what virtue is.
    * It is tried to be determined whether or not virtue can be taught or not.
    * You can't search for something that you don't know
    * Because if you don't cknow what it is, how can you search for it
    * If you already know something, you wouldn't search for it.
    * It's a paradox beacuse you are suppose to already know something, but if you don't know it how are you suppose to search for it
    * How did you ever know you had your keys in your right pocket to begin with if you didn't know it.
    * It is un-necessary or impossible because if you know it you don't need to know it, other 
    * Knowledge is impossible or un-necessary
- **Recollection**
    * Recollection is learning is recalling from within or from what you already know
    * You don't pick up anything new 
    * This is denying that teaching can actually happen
- **Pyrrhonism**
    * A school of skepticism, the other school is the acedemics
    * Say something about the nature of skepticism
    * Modern theories deny all knowledge is possible
    * Pyrrhonism denies that complete knowledge is possible
        - But concedes that some knowledge is possible
- **4 Psychological States From "The Divided Line" in Plato's Republic**
    * 4 States
        - **Visible Realms**
            * Imagination
            * Folk Wisdom or Confidence
        - **Intelligible Realm**
            * Thought or Systematic Knowing
            * Understanding - _actually grasps the forms_
    * People in cave are in visble realm, 
        - Outside cave are in intelligble realm
        - The visible realm doesn't appeal to the forms at all
        - People staring just at shadows are simply in eralm of imaginations
        - Folk wisdom have knowledge of items in cave, but do not undestand their just in cave
        - They need to know there is more out there
- **States of mind in Aristotle, especially technical expertise (techne), practical judgment (phronesis), systematic or scientific thinking (episteme)** (oct 8)
    * 5 States of Mind:
        - Techne: Professional Knowledge, knowledge of a craftsman, technical expertise, craft or skill
        - Phronesis: Practical Wisdom, ability to get things done in world
        - Episteme: Systematic knowledge, think about a **particular** area, scientific knowledge
        - Sophia/Wisdom: The grap of necessary truths, or what cannot be otherwise
        - Insight/Nous: Direct grasp of original /starting points (arche)
- **Subjectivism versus Intellectualism**
    * Subjectivism:
        - Protagoros is the origin
        - Said there are two people eating a meal, one healty, one is sick
        - Food is terrible , food is great
        - Both are correct, food is both good/terrible because all knowledge from perspective of person making knowledge claim

        - Plato is the origin
        - Wants to say sick person is wrong
        - Knowledge comes from the forms
        - How are the forms known, that's why its called intellectualism
        - Access from the intellect not hte senses
Short-answer questions
----------------------
- **What is the theory of knowledge established in Meno?**
    * Two claims about knowledge made in the Meno:
        - Theory of Recollection
            * Recollection as the route to the knowledge
            * Knowledledge is not taught, all learning is through recollecting
        - Atias Logismos / Posits Logic or Reasoning
            * Route leads to a full accounting
            * Knowledge is fully worked out when its invisible
            * Dialectic impregnability -- once the explaination is fully worked out, no more reasoning necessary
- **How is knowledge distinguished from true belief in Meno?**
    * Difference is that knowledge is actually proviiding a full acount
    * True belief is true, but cannot be sustained in conversation
    * One could mistake TB for false belief, the difference is you can defend knowledge
    * This theory of knowledge does not provide justifcation for nowledge claim
    * Explanation for knowledge claim
- **Identify three features of the pre-philosophical theory of knowledge.** (oct 1)
    * Knowledge as direct personal perception
        - Protagorous has subjectivism, Plato takes on intellectualism
    * Divine knowledge versus human knowledge
        - Divine knowledge comes from the gods
        - Humans will never be able to obtain divine knowledge
        - Not just denying that humans will ever have any knowledge
        - Just human knowledge is much more a degraded form
        - Plato: THe forms are the basis of knowledge, won't deny that humans can't know all forms
    * Denial that humans can make knowledge claims
    * Knowledge versus opinion
    * Probable truth versus certain truth
    * Possibility of expertise
    * New sources of authority in addition to revelation: sense perception and reasoned argument
- **Explain how those features are challenged or refined by Plato's and/or Aristotle's theories of knowledge.**
    * Need to say why a distinction was made
- **Explain the four reasons to suspend judgment according to Sextus Empiricus.**
    * Four Reasons
        - Dispute: 
            * When two people have disagreed opinions. 
            * Disagreement between two smart people, arguing for two view points
            * Only about incredibly diffucult matters
            * Two sides of argument each of which side has dialectic impregnability
        - Hypothesis:
            * An unsupported idea or an assumption
            * When ask, why is that true they just assume to be truth for the sake of argument
            * Conclusion only holds to the extent that the original premise holds
        - Reciprocity:
            * Circular Reasoning
            * A -> B -> A
        - Infinite Regress:
            * Any argument can always ask for more reasons
            * Chain of explanations 
            * You can always aska nother question: Why?
- **What is the Two Worlds Theory and what are its consequences? What evidence suggests that Plato subscribed to it? What evidence suggests that he did not?**
    * oct 15/17
    * likely question for exam, prezi
    * The Two Worlds Theory states that objects of knowledge are distinct from objects of belief
    * This rejects meno's account of knowledge
    * Skepticism about limits of human knowledge
    * Sensible realm is distinct from the intelligble realm
    * Only belief/opinion possible in sensible realm
    * Knowleg eonly possible in intelligble realm or "Platonic intellectualism"
- **What positions is Aristotle rejecting in his efforts to save perception?**
    * Rejects Plantonic Intelleticuatlism
    * Rejects 

    * Saves knowledge in perception
    * Aims to vindicate actual practice even more than Plato
    * Saves the common sense
    * No doubts that knowledge exist, question becomes, how do we delmit it
- **How does Aristotle defend the truth-value of perception?**
    * (slide 31, place of percept k)
    * Proper object of each sense defined as
        - That which cannot be percieved by another sense AND
        - That about which it is impossible to be decieved
    * Although our perceptions can decieve us
        - You can tutor your senses to be better
        - Your senses become better at doing their own work
        - You don't say a stick in water is bent, but rather it _looks_ bent
