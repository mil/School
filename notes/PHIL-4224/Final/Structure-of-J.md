The Structure of Justification
==============================

BonJour, Can empirical knowledge have a foundation?
---------------------------------------------------
1.  What is the regress problem and how does the foundationalist attempt to
leverage the regress problem to motivate their view? In answering this question,
be sure to say what foundationalism is.
2.
What are basic beliefs and how does the foundationalist attempt to use them to
answer the regress problem? In explaining what a basic belief is be sure to give
some examples of possible basic beliefs.
3.
BonJour argues that the foundationalist cannot actually solve the regress
problems using basic beliefs. Explain his argument.


Davidson, “A coherence theory of knowledge and justification”
-------------------------------------------------------------
1.  Davidson argues that sensory experiences or sensations cannot provide
epistemic foundations for our beliefs about the external world, even if they are
causally responsible for our beliefs about the external world. Why not?

Klein, “Human Knowledge and the Infinite Regress of Reasons”
------------------------------------------------------------
1.  Explain and motivate the Principle of Avoiding Arbitrariness (PAA) and the
Principle of avoiding Circularity (PAC). How do the PAA and the PAC lead to
infinitism? Which principle do coherentists violate? Which principle to
foundationalists violate?

2.  How might a reliabilist try argue that PAA is false? How, in turn, does Klein reply to the reliabilist and defend the PAA?

3.  How might someone try to argue that the PAA is false by drawing on other meta-
properties of beliefs? How does Klein reply to defend the PAA?

4.  How might someone try to argue that the PAA is false because some arbitrary
beliefs are acceptable? How does Klein reply on behalf of the PAA?

5.  Klein considers and rejects the possibility that infinitism leads to skepticism.  Explain that objection and Klein’s response.


Sosa, “The Raft and the Pyramid: coherence versus foundations in the theory of knowledge”
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

1.  Sosa claims that the coherentist critique of foundationalism depends on the
Intellectualist Model of Justification. What is the Intellectualist Model of
Justification? How does the coherentist critique of foundationalist depend on the
Intellectualist Model of Justification?

2. Sosa gives several arguments to the effect that the coherentist critique fails
because of its reliance on the Intellectual Model of Justification. Explain at least
one of those arguments.

3. Sosa argues that the foundationalist does not adequately motivate their position
by drawing on the regress argument. Explain one such way the foundationalist
attempts to motivate their view using the regress problem and then explain why
Sosa thinks that the argument fails.

4. What is formal foundationalism? How is substantive foundationalism a version of
formal foundationalism? How are different kinds of coherentism also versions of formal foundationalism?

5. Why, according to Sosa, is substantive foundationalism a better version of
formal foundationalism than coherentism?
