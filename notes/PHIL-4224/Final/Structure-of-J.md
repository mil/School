The Structure of Justification
==============================

BonJour, Can empirical knowledge have a foundation?
---------------------------------------------------
1.  **What is the regress problem and how does the foundationalist attempt to leverage the regress problem to motivate their view? In answering this question, be sure to say what foundationalism is.**
    - Out of the justified true belief analysis of knowledge rises the regress problem. If knowledge is justified true belief, then any true belief A to be considered knowledge must be justified by some other true belief B.  However, if we are to use the true belief B as our justification for A, it seems as if B must also be justified by some other more fundamental true belief C. Thus, there is an regress caused by the nature of a knowledge needing to be justified.
    - This pattern of regress in justification will continue and this is where the motivation for foundationalism arises. Foundationalism provides a sufficient stopping point for the regress problem. Foundationalism asserts than rather continue in this apparent regress of justification, if we consider some beliefs to be foundational or basic the regress ends. However, now the question turns to what is a basic or foundational belief. Depending on the style foundataionalist you are, this answer will vary.

2.  **What are basic beliefs and how does the foundationalist attempt to use them to answer the regress problem? In explaining what a basic belief is be sure to give some examples of possible basic beliefs.**
    - Basic beliefs are the ending point of the regress problem for the foundationalist. The foundationalist asserts that in order to end the regress problem at some point some belief must be so basic that is in a new class of belief. Depending on the kind of foundationalism you accept, the nature of your foundational beliefs can vary.
    - One kind of basic belief is the rendering centering around the idea of cognitive givenness. Cognitivily given basic beliefs are justified by reference rather than by further beliefs. The state of affairs in the world in which the cognitivly given basic beliefs arise they seem immediately apprehendable.  This is pragmatically equivalent to an immediate apprehension or intuition. One such basic belief may be the statement "the door is red". Although, one could pick apart the justification of this belief further, by reference it seems prima facie, intuitively foundational and unquestionable. Cognitively given beliefs are  examples of a sort of direct knowledge.
    - Alternatively under strong foundationalism there is the idea that a set of baisc beliefs may have some feature or property X which ground all basic beliefs. Any belief with property X may thus be said to be a basic belief. These basic beliefs need not much justified any further and all other beliefs may build upon them. Not so much epistemic as it is law.

3.  **BonJour argues that the foundationalist cannot actually solve the regress problems using basic beliefs. Explain his argument.**
    - In both cases mentioned before: the law like connection and the cognitive giveness, they are both insufficient and unsound groundings for knowledge. They end epistemic justification regress problem with ad-hoc solution. Sosa gives several arguments to the effect that the coherentist critique fails because of its reliance on the Intellectual Model of Justification. Explain at least one of those arguments.
    - If we assume the intellectual model of justification is detrimental for functionalism that further we must accept that any normative theory of epistmology is un-achievable. Since propositional attitudes can justify propositional attitudes ad no more, how do we say what this set of propositional attitudes supervenes on.
    - There are no ways to distinguish between cognitive given believes and epistemically concerned beliefs. Without a clear distinction between these two types of beliefs, there seems to be little true grounding for foundationalism.
    - They both resort to solve the epistemic justification problem by simply saying: at no point further epistemic justification is necessary. At this point, justification can take several forms but either way they just fall back into the pitfalls of skepticism.
    - What is supervenience?



Davidson, A coherence theory of knowledge and justification
-------------------------------------------------------------
1.  **Davidson argues that sensory experiences or sensations cannot provide epistemic foundations for our beliefs about the external world, even if they are causally responsible for our beliefs about the external world. Why not?**

Klein, Human Knowledge and the Infinite Regress of Reasons
------------------------------------------------------------
1.  **Explain and motivate the Principle of Avoiding Arbitrariness (PAA) and the Principle of avoiding Circularity (PAC). How do the PAA and the PAC lead to infinitism? Which principle do coherentists violate? Which principle to foundationalists violate?**
    - *The Principle of Avoiding Circularity* speaks to the foundationalist in that there can not be circularity of belief. For example, if subject S has justification for some x in y, then the ancestral justificatory evidence for y will not contain x. This supports the idea that justification is a linear path as foundationalist assert it to be.
    - The Principle of Avoiding Arbitariness (PAA) states that if S has justification for x then there is some reason r1 to S for x and there is some reason r2 availble to S for r1.
    - Both the PAA and the PAC lead to infinitism because:
        - Like the foundationalist they assert that justification is a linear path.
            * Unlike foundationalism, PAA prevents the infinist to specify the actual foundations or basic beliefs
                - Thus, PAA is the rule that infinitism violates
                - PAA prevents any arbirtary stoping point for justification, and the foundationalist will do just the oppostive
                    * THe foundationalist will say that at some point reasons stop and we can give some arbitrary "basic beliefs" or grounds
        - The coherentist will violate PAC
            * The coherentist will say that in the web of beleifs there is overlap
                - If they don't say this, there just a bullshitting in that theyre truly just foundationalists who wanna do a PAC
            * But either way, the coherentist violates PAC cause there can be no overlap for the infinitist
                - FOr the infinitist everything can always be questioned further, and there can always be more reasons given

2.  **How might a reliabilist try argue that PAA is false? How, in turn, does Klein reply to the reliabilist and defend the PAA?**
    - The reliablist might accept that the claim that the structure of reasons is infinite however deny that reasons are required at some point for knowledge or justification. This kind of strong reliablist would assert that at some point reason is both unattainable and un-necessary for knowledge.
    - Klein would assert that this is a drastically diminished form of reliablism. Removing the idea that human knowledge always has reasons would remove what makes human knowledge so unique.
    - Even if one were to assert strongly a radical reliablism in conceding that no form of knowledge requires rational beliefs, this would still fit within the infinitist's picture. For nothing else, infinitism in this case draws out the distinctive feature of knowledge. We should be able to distinguish between the sense of know in which a subject knows that p is roughly equivalent to the subject has the information that p (servo-mechanic sense of k) versus the full reasoned sense of knowledge epistemologist are often concerned. The higher sense in which knowledge is a practice which requires more reasoning, only PAA continues to work and thus the reliablist arguing against PAA fails here.
    - Basically the problem with the reliablist denying that PAA denys knowledge is unique sense in which nothing can ever be arbitrary because we can always ask for more reason

3.  **How might someone try to argue that the PAA is false by drawing on other meta- properties of beliefs? How does Klein reply to defend the PAA?**
    - Someone might try to argue that PAA is false by asserting that meta-justification. For example, if someone claims the door is red and does not feel it is necessary to give any further justification, they may appeal and say "due to property P, the claim is justified" (where P is we need not question our cognition, or any other basic meta reason). Either a foundationalist or a coherentist may choose to further argumentation in this way. Where P is could be any sort of meta-justification that steps out of the natural reasoning order or giving justification. Perhaps there is a certain temporal case; sequence or the claim is justified in virtue of some mental state or casual history.
    - In anycase, whatever meta-justification, Klein asks the question: "why is having p truth conducive?". If there is some answer to this question then the regress continues to progress down. Thus, the meta justification will have its own set of regress problems. Alternatively, if an answer to why having p is truth conducive is denied than the assertion is arbitrary and PAA is not avoided at all.

4.  **How might someone try to argue that the PAA is false because some arbitrary beliefs are acceptable? How does Klein reply on behalf of the PAA?**
    - Someone may argue against PAA asserting that without accepting arbitrary beliefs we cannot reach any particular goal. In fact, if our epistemic goal is a complete and accurate understanding of the world and arbitrary means maybe can get us there, why should we care if our means are arbitrary. If our basic arbitrary goals can get us an accurate picture of the world, if our means are arbitrary it need not matter. There's a probability that regardless well get to a complete and accurate understanding of the world.
    - Klein responds that pointing out that accepting this kind of arbitrariness avoids PAA simply by remaining prudential. This line of reasoning is purely to help achieve The goal and is only one way the goal may be achieved. We have no reason to this is the ultimate way to achieve a complete and accurate picture. This idea of rationality is purely instrumental in nature.
    - If at the base, we must accept that reasons are arbitrary, there seems to be no reason, other than an arbitrary one, that would allow that we should accept any reasons. Thus, in line of epistemic questioning we should maintain the purest questioning form of rationality and accept as little as possible in desires to get as close to the truth as possible.

5.  **Klein considers and rejects the possibility that infinistism leads to skepticism. Explain that objection and Klein's response.**
    - The general idea is that infinitism will lead into skepticism. Under infinitism there is no way to "settle" an issue because all reasoning seems to rest upon inferences. There are no foundations and thus all justification is conditional or provisional and no belief will ever become unprovisionally justified. 
    - The answer Klein gives is that it may be that you can never "settle" matters once and for all. Skepticism will always remain as long as there is no nitty gritty concrete answer to these questions. A theory X is not justified in transcendence, but rather any theory X is just more justified than other theory Y,Z, and W. Thus, it is true that we won't have any sort of "lifetime" guarantee that settles our knowledge once and for all... however, this is what makes human knowledge distinct from other seemingly doxastic kinds of knowledge. Our guarantee is limited. Whenever we may think any proposition p to be true, J is out limited garuntee that assures us we can question and try to figure out why that is the case.


Sosa, The Raft and the Pyramid: coherence versus foundations in the theory of knowledge
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.  **Sosa claims that the coherentist critique of foundationalism depends on the Intellectualist Model of Justification. What is the Intellectualist Model of Justification? How does the coherentist critique of foundationalist depend on the Intellectualist Model of Justification?**
    - The intellectualist model of justification is that justification is grounded in logical relations among propositions. As such the belief that the streets are wet (W) depends on two propositions: (A) it is raining out and (B) if (A) then the streets will be wet. From a simply modus ponus of A into B will yield (W). Or formally stated: A, A->B, thus B.
    - The coherentist uses this logical model of inference or the intellecutualist model of justification to critique the foundationalist model. The general lines of reasoning:
        * If a mental state does not give us direct contact with reality, then it provides no  garuntee against error. Further, all a mental state does not give us direct contact with reality (Pure existence, unfiltered concepts of belief). Thus, our mental states cannot provide garuntee against error and therefore not serve as a foundation for knowledge.
    - Further, from this line of reasoning, assuming that our mental states cannot give us a direct contact of reality, our mental states cannot therefore serve as a foundation for our knowledge. 

2. **Sosa gives several arguments to the effect that the coherentist critique fails because of its reliance on the Intellectual Model of Justification. Explain at least one of those arguments.**
    - If we assume the intellectual model of justification is detrimental for foundtaionalism that further we must accept that any normative theory of epistmology is un-achievable. Since propositional attitudes can justify propositional attitudes and no more, how do we say what this set of propositional attitudes supervenes on.
    - What is supervenience?

3. **Sosa argues that the foundationalist does not adequately motivate their position by drawing on the regress argument. Explain one such way the foundationalist attempts to motivate their view using the regress problem areliable belief forming process or other theories of the sort nd then explain why Sosa thinks that the argument fails.**

4. **What is formal foundationalism? How is substantive foundationalism a version of formal foundationalism? How are different kinds of coherentism also versions of formal foundationalism?**

5. **Why, according to Sosa, is substantive foundationalism a better version of formal foundationalism than coherentism?**
