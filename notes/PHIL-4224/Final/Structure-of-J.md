The Structure of Justification
==============================

BonJour, Can empirical knowledge have a foundation?
---------------------------------------------------
1.  What is the regress problem and how does the foundationalist attempt to leverage the regress problem to motivate their view? In answering this question, be sure to say what foundationalism is.
    - Out of the justified true belief analysis of knowledge rises the regress problem. If knowledge is justified true belief, then any true belief A to be considered knowledge must be justified by some other true belief B.  However, if we are to use the true belief B as our justification for A, it seems as if B must also be justified by some other more fundamental true belief C. Thus, there is an regress caused by the nature of a knowledge needing to be justified.
    - This pattern of regress in justification will continue and this is where the motivation for foundationalism arises. Foundationalism provides a sufficient stopping point for the regress problem. Foundationalism asserts than rather continue in this apparent regress of justification, if we consider some beleifs to be foundational or basic the regress ends. However, now the question turns to what is a basic or foundational belief. Depending on the style foundataionalist you are, this answer will vary.

2.  What are basic beliefs and how does the foundationalist attempt to use them to answer the regress problem? In explaining what a basic belief is be sure to give some examples of possible basic beliefs.
    - Basic beliefs are the ending point of the regress problem for the foundationalist. The foundationalist asserts that in order to end the regress problem at some point some belief must be so basic that is in a new class of belief. Depending on the kind of foundationalism you accept, the nature of your foundational beliefs can vary.
    - One kind of basic belief is the rendering centering around the idea of cognitive givenness. Cognitivily given basic beliefs are justified by refence rather than by further beliefs. The state of affairs in the world in which the cognitivly given basic beliefs arise they seem immediatly apprehendable.  This is pragmatically equivialnt to an immediate apprehension or intuitino. One such bais belief may be the statement "the door is red". Although, one could pick apart the justification of this belief further, by refrence it seems prima facie, intuitivly fouindational and unquestionable. Cognitivly given beliefs are  examples of a sort of direct knowledge.
    - Alternativly under stong foundationalism there is the idea that a set of baisc beliefs may have some feature or property X which ground all baisc beliefs. Any belief with property X may thus be said to be a basic belief. THese basic beliefs need not much justified any further and all other beliefs may build upon them. Not so much epistemoic as it is law.

3.  BonJour argues that the foundationalist cannot actually solve the regress problems using basic beliefs. Explain his argument.
    - IN both cases mentioned before: the law like connection and the cognitive giveness, they are both insufficient and unsound groundings for knowledge. They end epistemic justification regreess problem with ad-hoc solutions. There are no ways to distinguish between cognitive given believes and epistemically concerned beleifs. Without a clear distinction between these two types of beliefs, there seems to be little true grounding for foundatlism.
    - They both resort to solve the epistemic justification poblem by simply saying: at no point further epistemic justification is necessary. At this point, justification can take several forms but either way they just fall back into the pitfalls of skepticism.



Davidson, “A coherence theory of knowledge and justification”
-------------------------------------------------------------
1.  Davidson argues that sensory experiences or sensations cannot provide epistemic foundations for our beliefs about the external world, even if they are causally responsible for our beliefs about the external world. Why not?

Klein, “Human Knowledge and the Infinite Regress of Reasons”
------------------------------------------------------------
1.  Explain and motivate the Principle of Avoiding Arbitrariness (PAA) and the Principle of avoiding Circularity (PAC). How do the PAA and the PAC lead to infinitism? Which principle do coherentists violate? Which principle to foundationalists violate?

2.  How might a reliabilist try argue that PAA is false? How, in turn, does Klein reply to the reliabilist and defend the PAA?

3.  How might someone try to argue that the PAA is false by drawing on other meta- properties of beliefs? How does Klein reply to defend the PAA?

4.  How might someone try to argue that the PAA is false because some arbitrary beliefs are acceptable? How does Klein reply on behalf of the PAA?

5.  Klein considers and rejects the possibility that infinitism leads to skepticism.  Explain that objection and Klein’s response.


Sosa, “The Raft and the Pyramid: coherence versus foundations in the theory of knowledge”
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

1.  Sosa claims that the coherentist critique of foundationalism depends on the Intellectualist Model of Justification. What is the Intellectualist Model of Justification? How does the coherentist critique of foundationalist depend on the Intellectualist Model of Justification?

2. Sosa gives several arguments to the effect that the coherentist critique fails because of its reliance on the Intellectual Model of Justification. Explain at least one of those arguments.

.
3. Sosa argues that the foundationalist does not adequately motivate their position by drawing on the regress argument. Explain one such way the foundationalist attempts to motivate their view using the regress problem and then explain why Sosa thinks that the argument fails.

4. What is formal foundationalism? How is substantive foundationalism a version of formal foundationalism? How are different kinds of coherentism also versions of formal foundationalism?

5. Why, according to Sosa, is substantive foundationalism a better version of formal foundationalism than coherentism?
