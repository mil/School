The Value of Knowledge
====================== 

Zagzebski, The search for the source of epistemic good
-------------------------------------------------------
1.  **What is the value problem of knowledge? Why does reliabilism offer a particularly bad answer to the value problem?**
    - The value problem is that we want to be able to distinguish what is the value of a justified true belief (or knowledge) over mere true belief. An example of this is say you are taking a multiple choice test and in one scenario you studied and correctly answer all the questions by applying you knowledge to the test. In another scenario you simply guess each question randomly, but as it turns out, you get every question right on the test. Why is there more value in having knowledge of the answers than having the mere true belief for each answer?
    - Reliablism  attempts to solve this problem by asserting that reliably held beliefs a more frequently or reliably deliver true beliefs than merely seeking out true beliefs. However, Zagzebski points out that truth plus an independently valuable source cannot explain the value of knowledge itself. In analogy, imagine two coffee machines, one is a $5000 premium exclusive coffee machines that exclusively spit out the best cups of coffee you drink in your life. Then imagine another coffee machine that spits out some pretty horribly tasting coffee but every once in a while spits out a coffee equivalent to the one from the $5000 machine. In this instance, is there any difference between the value of two coffees that are identical in composition and from from the two different machines?
    - The point here is that an independently valuable source (or a reliable mechanism) coupled with a TB does not explain the value of knowledge. Further, this disconnect of value is derived from the machine product model of knowledge. I.E TB + J = K. Justification is the machine that transforms an invaluable TB into valuable K. Cognitive methods as seen as justificatory to reliablism fail to make the true belief better in any way.
    - In the machine product model as proposed by reliablism: the product is distinct from the machine and this disconnect makes it so the value of each is evalutated speartly. If we just evaluate the value of the TB in the end, reliably formed TBs are no different from non reliably formed TB is mere value.

2.  **Zagzebski draws three morals of the value problem. Explain each moral, using examples to illustrate the morals.**
    - Moral #1: *Truth plus a reliable source cannot explain knowledge.*
        * Reliable methods in forming belief do not make the actual true beliefs any better.
        * If there are two espresso machines....
            - Mainly the disconnect between the machine and the product is relevant here
    - Moral #2: *Truth plus an independently valuable source cannot explain the value of K*
        * Reliability is not good indpendent of everything else
            - Agent --> action (is to)
            - Agent --> true belief
            - There is nothing especially valuable about reliability other than it gets us to the truth more frequently
        * The reliablity of the machine doesn't give a shit about the product itself
    - The third moral is: *Knowing is related to the knower not as product to machine but as to act agent*
        * Achieving knowledge is admirable
        * There are undesirable true beliefs
        * Agent or subject does something to credit given to agent or subject
            - Agent or subject does something to earn the praise or blame that comes with knowledge
        * Leads to creation of hierarhcial foundation for the value of k
        * *Thus:* We should view Knower to TB as not *Machine/Product* but as *Agent/Act*
3.  **How does Zagzebski invoke the love of truth to develop an answer to the value problem? Why does she believe that an answer to the value problem simply based on the love of truth is not an adequate answer to the value problem?**
    - Good beliefs are formed based on love of truth (eudamonia)
        * Its good for you = Desirable
        * It is an important acheivment = Admirable
    - Explaining the value of knowledge is flowing from the credit the agent gets from the true belief
        * True belief due to love of truth
    - Value Hierachy of TBs:
        * ~D & ~A --> strong racist predjucice
        * Two fold:
            * A & ~D --> wife cheating on you, admirable, not desirable
            * D & ~A --> cheating on a test, or knowing how to make a nuclear bomb
        * D & A ---> Any JTB
    - However, We must go above this heirarchy to explain  K's value
        * D&A that are somehow connected is better than unconnect D & A
        * Value of knowledge flow in part from the motive
            - Value of Actor (Eudamonia) --flows to--> Value of Act ---flows to---> Value of TB
            - Value of actor must be question
                * In here is the desirability and admirability

4.  **Describe what Zagzebski calls the New Gettier Problem, based in the value problem. How is it similar to the original Gettier problem? How is it different? Be sure to explain the difference between admirable beliefs and desirable beliefs.**
    - The new Gettier problem is the difference between success through virtue and success and virtue.
        * Fake barn case
            - Call barn a barn, success and virtue
    - Appears that you have succes and virtue 
        * Success and virtue = can be attributiable to luck
        * Success through virtue cannot be attributed to luck
            - In Gettier case you may have a desirable belief that was formed admirably, however the two are not connected
            - The desirable component of the belief is not adirmable?
            - [[[Need to figure out how these are related]]]

Greco, The value problem
-------------------------
1.  **Greco carefully separates out four different questions that one might pose as the "value problem" in epistemology. Explain each question and how it differs from the other.**
    - The four questions are
        1. Why is knowledge valuable?
        2. Why is knowledge more valuable than true belief?
        3. Why is knowledge more valuable than any subset of its parts?
        4. Why is knowledge more valuable than the value of all of its parts speratly?
    - (1) is the very broad question which is often referred to as the value problem.  However, (1) typically arises out of our pre-thoretic conviction that knowledge must be more valuable in some way than true belief. This pretheoritic idea that knowledge is in fact more valuable than true belief is the topic of the Meno and primarily answered by (2). Further, it seems if an adequate answer could be given to (2), (1) would follow since out of the virtue that knowledge is more valuable than true belief, we would understand why knowledge is valuable: simply, its more valuable than true belief. Thus, the main question the value problem is concerned with is that of (2).
    - Another question that arises from the value problem is pointed out by Kvanig in the form of (3). The idea that we should be able to explain the value of knowledge in comparison with any subset of its parts. For example, why is knowledge more valuable than a justified belief is entailed in this question as is why is knowledge more valuable than justified true belief. Additionally, (3) entails, why is knowledge more valuable than justified true belief + some additional criteria.
    - The fourth question seeks to understand why knowledge is more valuable than the additive value of knowledges parts taken separately. For example, when we say a bachelor is an unmarried man, being unmarried and being a man both have individual value assignment. The question (4) is concerned with is why is knowledge itself or the combined value of all of the components of knowledge taken together any more valuable than the individual added value of each component of knowledge (traditionally construed as J+T+B).

2.  **Explain which questions about the value of knowledge need not be answered by an account of knowledge and why.**
    - An account of knowledge according to Greco need not be concerned with (3) or (4) because doing so has no value outside of pretheoretic conviction. Simply, wondering about the answers to (3) or (4) is not something we naturally are curious to discover. These questions are only visible in the overt and intentional pretheorthic analysis of knowledge. Put simply, they only arise out of the over analysis of (2) leading to the over analysis of (1).
    - However, (2) and (1) are perfectly reasonable questions to be asking. (2) is reasonable because we naturally think that knowledge is more valuable than true belief and we wish to explain this difference. (1) is a good question to ask because it is just a more generally rendering of (2) and possibly can stand independent of (2) if we find an adequate answer. 

3.  **What is Greco's proposed solution to the value problem? How, in particular, is it similar to certain kinds of solutions to the original Gettier problem? Be sure to use examples to illustrate Greco's solution.**
    - Greco proposes that we invoke a sort of success through virtue in order to solve the value problem. Knowledge is valuable because it is intrinsically good and constitutive of human flourishing. Seeking true beliefs and avoiding false beliefs is such that we are searching for knowledge rather than just true beliefs. Flipping a coin and hoping you get a true belief is not constitutive of human flourishing and a "love" or virtue of knowledge. This is the added value of knowledge over true beliefs. Knowledge can be sought after, it is intentional, and virtuous. On the contrary just having true beliefs is not virtuous and it is questionable whether one can ever seek true beliefs in such manner without invoking a success through virtue.
    - This solution is similar to the Gettier problem solutions in that each adhere that we formed true beliefs on good based justification. Each solution to the Gettier problem seeks to affix additional criteria to JTB and thus avoid gettiered TBs. However, regardless while they may not always succeed and a truth-tracking theory or other knowledge theories of the sort may not always succeed they adhere that we use good virtues.
    - Regardless, the idea is that we should always be atleast trying to get at the closest thing to the truth as this is the nature of inquiry
    

Sosa, The place of truth in epistemology
----------------------------------------
1.  **Sosa isolates four different ways in which beliefs can be valuable by virtue of being true. One of those ways is a way in which all beliefs, merely as true, are valuable. Explain this value of true beliefs and why Sosa thinks that merely accounting for this kind of value of true beliefs is not enough to account for the value of knowledge.**
    - **Ways in Which Belief can be Valuable** (NOTE: not needed to be stated to answer question, only concerned with mere intrinsic TB in question)
        * **Instrinsic**
            - A belief can be intrinsicly value just out of the virtue that it is a true belief
        * **Instrumental** (or performance value if you assign value)
            - A belief can be valuable in term of it being able to generate other true beliefs 
            - Leads to more true beliefs
        * **Instric Praxical**
            - A belief can be valuable in terms of valuing the act of getting at the truth
            - This may have ties in with eduamonia
        * **Extrnsic Praxical**
            - Others may evaluate a belief in term of it being adhering to the truth
            - That was a good action to take in regards to conforming to the truth
    - Sosa believes that if the value of true beliefs is merely in the virtue that they are true, any belief that is true is valuable. The problem with this view is that true beliefs are not valuable in and of themselves but only in answering questions of higher order. For example, one many pick up a handful of sand on the beach and count each grain and at the end wind up with a true belief of the number of grains of sand there were. However, there seems little value in knowing the number of grains of sands and having the truth about this number independent of that belief itself.
    - Rather than randomly seeking true beliefs, truth is something we seek when we seek out belief. This can be understood by an analogy of eating nutritious food. We all need food and seek out food to stay alive. Furthermore, it is likely we seek out and desire nutritious food over non-nutritious food, however this is only a virtue of eating food to begin with. We do not value nutritiousness of food independent of food itself but rather nutritiousness is a mere virtue to adhere to. Similarly, truth is not valuable in and of itself but rather valuable in the generation of belief. We prefer true beliefs to false beliefs but ultimately our end goal is mere belief.
     

2. **True beliefs can have what Sosa calls an extrinsic, or instrumental, value.  Explain what this value of true beliefs is and why it alone is not enough to account for the value of knowledge.**
    - True beliefs can have instrumental value in that they may cause more true beliefs. For example, if you consider you know the proposition a -> b. Then if you have a true belief of a then you also intuitively will be able to derived the true belief of b. The reason you are enabled to make this derivation is through the virtue that a and a->b are both true beliefs. Thus, you may conclude that b. The instrumental value of the true beliefs allowed you to connect a & a->b and get another true belief b. Further, the b is valuable just in virtue of being true as is a and a -> b.
    - However, this instrumental value which in lamemans terms lets us derive more intrinsically valuable true belief from known true beliefs is not alone enough to explain the value of knowledge. Consider a world scenario in where there are 3 events X Y and Z. In one world X Y and Z and casually linked, such that X causes Y which later causes Z. This casual linking is equivalent to the extrinsic value we can note in true beliefs. In the other world X Y and Z are not casually associated but never the less occur independent.
    - In these two worlds, the total value is merely derived from the value of X&Y&Z and since in both worlds since all three events occurred it is irrelevant if one caused another. As such, instrumental value cannot in isolation be treated to have value or be virtuous if the thing we intrinsically value is the true beliefs themselves.

3. **True beliefs can have what Sosa calls Praxical, intrinsic value. What is this kind of value and, in particular, how is it different from the merely instrumental value a true belief has?**
    - If you assume that some agent S performs some action that brings about E. E is independently intrinsically valuable in its own right. S's bring about E has value in that it is instrumental (value in this case lies soley in E's ultimate value), however S's action bringing about E also has praxical value. The praxical value is the intrinsic value in the action itself!
    - Unlike in the two worlds example, in the world casually connected there may not be more intrinsic value in the events themselves there is intrinsic value in the actions. This value is the praxical value that can be attributed to the agent performing the action. As such when somebody comes upon a true belief through some actions, those actions themself are virtuous independent of the value of the true belief. This is what separates praxical value from instrumental value.
    - Instrumental value is only valuable in virtue of the intrinsic value of the end event. However, praxical value is the notion that there is value in the action itself. This value can be assigned to the agent and is of higher worth than mere instrumental value.
    - Archer EX
    - Intrinsic praxical = truth attributed to agent bringing out the truth

4. **Sosa claims that even false beliefs can have what he calls Performance Value.  What is performance value? What light does it shed on the value of knowledge, if any?**
    - Performance value is value of performances of agents that is double faced. Performance value is evaluated in terms of the outcome of the performance and in addition to the agent involved in the performance. Credible performances are attributable to the agents skills and virtues and thus attributed to the agent ultimately.
    -  Consider a man who forms the belief that he is thinking, p. Now consider two worlds, one in which the man forms this belief because he is actually thinking and the world is as it appears to him. Alternatively consider that the man's thought is just a brain in a vat case. Someone stimulated him to believe this. In this second case we would credit the performance value of the man to be of equal worth to that of the man in the first case. However, in the second case, regardless of the performance value there is less value in terms of knowledge.
    - This has wide implications for epistemology and furthermore it just points back to the idea our knowledge fundamentally will have no value without extrinsic value. There is no epistemic intrinsic value to our epistemic knowledge outside of performance value.
    - Performance value of deliverance induced believing is measured by how well we performed
    - It could be that there is no *ultimate value* in that no one assigned value to the world, however we can still value performance
        * This links back in with eduamonia once again

Brady, Evaluative attitudes
---------------------------
1.  **What is the distinction that Brady draws between Acitve and Passive Evaluative Attitudes?**
    - Brady draws a distinction between active and passive evaluative attitudes. Active evaluative attitudes are attitudes that are formed intentionally with adherence to virtues in mind. Examples of these attitudes include verbs such as: bring about, maintaining, contemplating, protecting, guarding, so on and so forth. These active attitudes are many of the possible ways in which we can love or value the truth. The relevant point is that active evaluative attitudes are true seeking and motivated positively in the pursuit of the truth.
    - Active evaluative attitudes are put in contrast with passive evaluative attitudes. Passive evaluative attitudes are contemplative attitudes such as acceptance, affirm, embrace, respect, and so on and so forth. These attitudes have less value in that they are less goal or pursuit oriented toward the truth.

2.  **Brady draws a distinction between active and passive evaluative attitudes. He then uses that distinction to argue that reliabilism can solve the value problem of in epistemology. Explain his argument.**
    - Brady argues that only active attitudes are conducive toward the epistemic goal of seeking the truth. To this he adds that active attitudes may be used to form reliably-formed true beliefs (RTB) however active attitudes cannot be used to form accidentally formed true beliefs (ATB). Accidentally formed true beliefs come about passively. It would be absurd to say you have a love or a pursuit toward ATB formed purely through randomly stumbling upon the truth.
    - Thus, while RTB can be virtuous in a sense, ATB cannot possess these same virtues. Thus, the value of RTB is greater than the value of ATB. In this way we seek knowledge as defined as reliably formed true beliefs  in contrast.

3.  **Brady considers three objections to his argument that reliabilism can solve the value problem in epistemology. Pick on one of these objections and explain (i) the objection and (ii) how Brady responds to the objection.**
    - One objection Brady offers is that it seems obvious that we should value RTB over ATB, however what about in the case of Gettier (GTB). It may be the case that we value RTB and actively go about our pursuit of the truth but we wind up with GTBs which we shouldn't value any higher than ATBs.
    - Brady's response to this problem is that GTBs are unlike ATBs and RTBs all together in that we cannot seek out anomalous or lucky factors leading to GTBs. Further, it may be that a GTB is no more valuable than an ATB. However, what we can do is seek out RTBs which are naturally of a more appropriate active evaluative attitude.
    - GTBs will always be unavoiding, however that does not mean we should stop our seeking of RTBs. GTBs are most likely on the same value level as ATBs, however the distinction that is relevant is that RTBs can be sought after ATB may be accredited and GTBs may be unavoidable, but only RTBs are virtuous.
