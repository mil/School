The Value of Knowledge
====================== 

Zagzebski, The search for the source of epistemic good
-------------------------------------------------------
1.  What is the value problem of knowledge? Why does reliabilism offer a particularly bad answer to the value problem?
    - The value problem is that we want to be able to distinguish what is the value of a justified true belief (or knowledge) and mere true belief. An example of this is say you are taking a multiple choice test and in one scenario you studied and correctly answer all the questions by applying you knowledge to the test. In another scenario you simply guess each question randomly, but as it turns out, you get every question right on the test. Why is there more value in having knowledge of the answers here than having the mere true belief for each answer?
    - Reliablism  attempts to solve this problem by asserting that reliably held believes on a more frequenty or reliable scale deliver more true beliefs. However, Zagzebski points out that truth plus a mere independtly valuable source cannot explain the value of knowledge itself. IN analogy, imagine two coffee machines, one is a $5000 premium exclusive coffee machines that exclusivly spit out the best cups of coffee you drink in your life. Then imagine another coffee machine that spits out some pretty horribly tasting coffe but every once in a while spits out a coffee equiivlant to the one from the $5000 machine. In this instance, is there any difference between the value of two coffees that are identical in composition and from from the two different machines?
    - The point is that a indepedntly valuable source (or a reliable mechanism) coupled with a TB does not explain the value of knowledge. Further, this disconnect of value is derived from the machine product model of knowledge. I.E TB + J = K. Justification is the machine that transforms an unvaluable TB into valuable K. Cognitive methods as seen as justificatory to reliablism fail to make the Truebelief better in any way.

2.  Zagzebski draws three morals of the value problem. Explain each moral, using examples to illustrate the morals.
    - The first moral is that truth plus a reliable source cannot explain knowledge.
        * Reliable methods in forming belief do not make the actual true beliefs any better.
        * If there are two espresso machines....
    - The second moral is that: **Truth plus an independently valuable source cannot explain the value of K**
        * Reliability is not good indpendent of everything else
            - agent --> action
            - agent --> true belief
            - There is nothing especially valuable about reliability other than it gets us to the truth more frequently

3.  How does Zagzebski invoke the love of truth to develop an answer to the value problem? Why does she believe that an answer to the value problem simply based on the love of truth is not an adequate answer to the value problem?

4.  Describe what Zagzebski calls the New Gettier Problem, based in the value problem. How is it similar to the original Gettier problem? How is it different? Be sure to explain the difference between admirable beliefs and desirable beliefs.

Greco, The value problem
-------------------------
1.  Greco carefully separates out four different questions that one might pose as the ‘value problem’ in epistemology. Explain each question and how it differs from the other.

2.  Explain which questions about the value of knowledge need not be answered by an account of knowledge and why.
4.

3.  What is Greco’s proposed solution to the value problem? How, in particular, is it similar to certain kinds of solutions to the original Gettier problem? Be sure to use examples to illustrate Greco’s solution.

Sosa, The place of truth in epistemology
----------------------------------------
1.  Sosa isolates four different ways in which beliefs can be valuable by virtue of being true. One of those ways is a way in which all beliefs, merely as true, are valuable. Explain this value of true beliefs and why Sosa thinks that merely accounting for this kind of value of true beliefs is not enough to account for the value of knowledge.

2. True beliefs can have what Sosa calls an extrinsic, or instrumental, value.  Explain what this value of true beliefs is and why it alone is not enough to account for the value of knowledge.

3. True beliefs can have what Sosa calls Praxical, intrinsic value. What is this kind of value and, in particular, how is it different from the merely instrumental value a true belief has?

4. Sosa claims that even false beliefs can have what he calls Performance Value.  What is performance value? What light does it shed on the value of knowledge, if any?

Brady, Evaluative attitudes
---------------------------
1.  What is the distinction that Brady draws between Acitve and Passive Evaluative Attitudes?
    - Brady draws a distinction between active and passive evaluative attitues. An active evaluative attitude are attitudes that are formed intentionally with adherence to virtues in mind. Examples of these attitudes include verbs such as: bring about, mainting, contemplating, protecting, guarding, so on and so forth. These active attitudes are many of the possible ways in which we can love or value the truth. The relevant point is that active evaluative attitudes are true seeking and motivated positivly in the pursuit of the truth.
    - Active evaluative attitudes are put in contrast with passive evaluative attitudes. Passive evluative attittudes are contemplative attitudes such as acceptance, affirm, embrace, respect, and so on and so forth. These attitudes have less value in that they are less goal or pursuit oriented toward the truth.

2.  Brady draws a distinction between active and passive evaluative attitudes. He then uses that distinction to argue that reliabilism can solve the value problem of in epistemology. Explain his argument.
    - Brady argues that only active attitudes are conducive toward the epistemic goal of seeking the truth. To this he adds that active attitudes may be used to form reliably-formed true beliefs (RTB) however active attitudes cannot be used to form accidentially formed true beliefs (ATB). Accidentially formed true beliefs come about passivly. It would be absurd to say you have a love or a pursuit toward ATB formed purely through randomly stumbling upon the truth.
    - Thus, while RTB can be virtuous in a sense, ATB cannot possess these same virtues. Thus, the value of RTB is greater than the value of ATB. In this way we seek knowledge as defined as reliably formed true beliefs  in contrast.

3.  Brady considers three objections to his argument that reliabilism can solve the value problem in epistemology. Pick on one of these objections and explain (i) the objection and (ii) how Brady responds to the objection.
    - One objection Brady offers is that it seems obvious that we should value RTB over ATB, however what about in the case of Gettier (GTB). It may be the case that we value RTB and activly go about our persuit of the truth but we wind up with GTBs which we shouldn't value any higher than ATBs.
    - Brady's response to this problem is that GTBs are unlike ATBs and RTBs all together in that we cannot seek out anamoulous or lucky factors leading to GTBs. Further, it may be that a GTB is no more valuable than an ATB. However, what we can do is seek out RTBs which are naturally of a more appropriate active evaluative attitude.
