Alston, The Deontological conception of epistemic justification
---------------------------------------------------------------
1.  What is the deontological conception of epistemic justification? What, according to Alston, are the twin epistemic goals that guide epistemic principles of justification? If there is an adequate deontological conception of epistemic justification, how does it relate to the twin epistemic goals?

2.  What is a basic action, according to Alston? According to Alston, is the decision whether to believing that p something that can be a basic action?

3.  What is non-basic immediate voluntary control? How is it different from basic control? According to Alston, we do not have non-basic immediate voluntary control over our beliefs. Why not?

4.  What is long-rage voluntary control? How is it different from basic control or non- basic immediate voluntary control? According to Alston, we do not have long- range voluntary control over our beliefs. Why Not?

5.  What is indirect voluntary influence? How is it different from long-range voluntary control. How does Alston use this kind of control over our beliefs to develop a deontological sense of epistemic justification?

6.  Alston gives two arguments for the conclusion that the deontological sense of
justification is not a sense of justification that epistemologists have traditionally
been interested in. Explain one of those arguments.
