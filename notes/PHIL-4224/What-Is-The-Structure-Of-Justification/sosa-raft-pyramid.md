1. Coherentist Critique of Foundationalism on the Basis of the Impossibility of Basic Beliefs is a "Proves too Much" Argument
    - Precursor
        * Particularism versus Methodism
            - **Particularism**: What do we know
            - **Methodism**: How do we know
    - Objection to Foundationalism
        1. It is incompatible with human limitations  --> No human subject could harbor the required infinity of beliefs
            * Response: Can't be sure if this is true
                - Methodism?
        2. Indeed infinite regress is ruled out in principle because if infinite, how could it possibly end?
            * Response:
                - Temporal End -> Subject could be eternal / Etnernal mind|subject
                    * In principle, a temporal end may not exist or matter
                - Justificatory End -> If the end mention is justificatory
                    * To ask how justification may end is to just beg the question
                    * How can we ever settle anything? - But why should we assume that we need to stop it?
        3. Make 2 Assumptions:
            * 1) S's belief that q, justified S's belief that p IFF  
            * Response:
                - Have r provides good evidence for p via q1.....qn  <-- this kind of belief will omit members of full regress

        4. Perefect # > 100, Atleast 1 Perefect # > 100, Atleast 2 Perfect # > 100, Atleast 3 Perfect # > 100

        5. Actual only contains 


2. Regress Argument fails to Establish Foundationalism

3. Foundationalism and Coherentism are both Instances of a More General Kind of "Foundationlism"

4. This more general "Foundationalism" recommends a new Approach to Epistemology
