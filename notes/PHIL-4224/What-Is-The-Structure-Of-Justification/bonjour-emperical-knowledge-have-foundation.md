Bonjour: Can Empirical Knowledge Have Foundation?
=================================================
- Basics:
    * The Regress Problem:
        - JTB leads to a regress problem
        - If A is justified by B, B must be jusified by C, C justified by D......
    * Foundationalism
        - Motivated by the Regress problem
        - The regress must stop at some point
- Where to Go From the Regress Problem:
    * Skepticism
    * Regress proceeds Infintly Backwards 
        - Justification ends with beliefs of which no justification available
    * Coherentism
        - Regress just circles upon itself
    * Foundationalism
        - Regress ends in some beliefs w/o J
        - Variants:
            * Strong Foundationalism
                - Regress ultimatly ends in a some "basic belief"
                - Basic beliefs need no justification
                - Basic beliefs are very liekly to be true
            * Weak Foundationalism
                - Accepts central Foundatalist concept
                - Basic Beliefs have quite low degree of warrant
                    * Lower than strong foundationalism
                    * Insufficient to satisfy J condition for K
                - Hybrid between strong foundationalism and coherence view
        - Key Problem for Foundationalism
            * Can it solve the regress problem w/o ad hoc stipulation?
- Basic Beliefs:
    * Serve as the foundation for strong foundationalism
    * Defined by the foundationalist theory








Older Shit:
-----------

- Coherentism (Davidson)
    * Beliefs are only justified by other beliefs
- Foundationalism
    * 

1st Part
--------
- Coherentist
    * What does coherence have to do with truth?
- Foundationalist
    * Davidson: Foundationalist has no response to the skeptic
        - Either fails or collapses to coherentist view
    * Relation between sensations and beliefs
        - (beliefs) Some class of perceptual beliefs
        - ? Sensations **are** beliefs
- Justification -> Cause -> Belief
    * Cause = Senses?
    * What comes before the cause,
    * Must look for justification in the meaning of what your believing

- The problem for the foundationalist is that confrontation between belief & truth/world
    * Davidson:There is no difference between belief and truth...
    * Truth and belief do not come apart
    * By their nature, beliefs are true
- Beliefs by their nature are ture and coherent
    * Are false beliefs possible?
        - Yes, part of beliefs is that it is possible for t/f
        - But by having a belief, it is implied it is true
- Belief is defined w/in interpretation & coherent
    * Interpretation requires principle of charity possible?
    * Charity requires truth
    * So, belief requires truth
