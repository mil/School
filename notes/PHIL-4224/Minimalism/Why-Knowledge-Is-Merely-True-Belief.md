Why Knowledge is Merely True Belief -- Crispin Sartwell
=======================================================
- Terminological Groundwork
    * Knowledge = Our Epistemic goal in the generation of particular propositional beliefs
    * Inquiry = Procedures that have as their goal generation of belief with regard to particular propositions
        * There are wider epistemic goals than K
            - Ex: Rationality, Wisdom
    * Theory of Epistemic Justification
        - Does two things:
            1. Gives general procedures for inquiry
            2. Set standards for ealuating productions of inquiry
        - Belief is justified if:
            * Produced by correct procedure for inquiry
            * Evluative it positivly along epistmic lines
        - NOT Anarchy..., Justification is important
    * Normative versus Descriptive
        - Descriptive Epistemology
            * Branch of Psychology/Cognitive Science
            * How do we come to believe or know?
            * What causal cirumstances/ cognitive mechanisms?
        - Normative Epistemology
            * Purely philosophical principle
            * How should we generate beliefs in regard to getting K
            * K=TB is a normative concern

- Deontological and Teleological Conceptions
    * In Ethics:
        - Deontological
            * Obligations and permission
            * Moral actions as what is done in obidience to principles
            * Serve in turn no end that could be looked on as overall moral ground
        - Teleological
            * Morally good conduces to some goal
            * I.e Utilitiarianism, Hedonism
    * Apply Deonotological  v Teleological to Epistemology
        - Deontological: permission, ideals, obligaionts
        - Teleogical: goal and end-game of epistemology for inquiry
    * Deontological Guide to Inquiry
        - Believe only whats in the bible
        - Criticism: 
            * What is the source of our epistemic obligations?
            * Reply: God, or State
        - Thus, Deontological conception of epi norms unprob 
    * Injunctive Teleological Accounts of Normative Epistemology
        - By analogy to utilitarnism 
        - Yield duties or permission that conduece to knowledge
        - Alston: presupposes doxastic volunatrism
            * Idea that Beliefs are under voluntary control
