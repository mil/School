Goldman Reliablism
==================
- Externalist View
- Knowledge Account: S know that p iff.........
- Justification Account: S has a **Justified Belief** iff ........ 
- **Conditions**:
  * Only **Non-Epistemic Terms**
    - Ex: Belief, Causes, Necesitate, Implies, Is True, Is Probable
    - Versus Epistemic Terms Ex: Justified, Warant, Good Grounds
- **Failures -> Diagnose common features** of those failures
    * Our **proper account** should remedy those failures
    * Failures:
        - **Indubitable**: S has JB that P iff p is indubitable (cannot doubt) for S
          * Psychological
            - Counter-example able
          * Epistemlogical
            - No grounds to doubt
        - **Self Evident**: S has a JB that p iff j
          * Epistomological
            - Impossible to understand without believing it
              * Impossible for humanns
                - Ex: Kantian, everything has a cause
          * Impossible for anyone/antyhing
    - **Self Intimating**: S has JB that p iff p
      * (if p, the s believes p)
      * see red, mind believs that you are seeing red
      * Nomological Necessity
      * Logical Necessity
- Problem w/ Failures: The **way** in which the **belief is held**
    * The failures don't take into account way in which you form the belief
    * Good way to hold a belief: (reliable)
        - Having lots of good reasons and using them
        - Perception
        - Testimoney
        - Scientific Inquiry
        - Memory?
    * Bad ways to hold a belief: (unreliable)
        - Hasy Generalization
        - Wishful Thinking
        - Confused Reasoning (Bad Inferences)
        - Guessing
    * Difference between good and bad is reliability
- Goldman Stance
    * 1st Attempt - Conditional:
        - If: S's belief that p is formed by a **reliable process**
            * **Reliable**: How to evaluate?
            * What is a proccess?
                - Perception/Visual Perception/Color Constancy Tracking
                - Generality?
                - Extension
        - Then: S belief that p is justified
    * Note: Goldman says that Justification is relevant to what you are doing
    * Belief Process takes some Input --> Belief
      - **Reliable:** Some Other Beliefs ---> Beliefs
        * Belief Dependent
      - **UnReliable**: No Ohter Beliefs ---> Beliefs
        - Belief Independent
      * Conditional Reliability: True belief inputs yield reliably true beliefs

- Conditional
    * **If:** S's believing p at t results from a reliable cognitive belief-forming process (or set of processes)
  * **Then:** S's belief in p at t is justified
