1. Lessons for accounts of knowledge from the value problem
2. The value of truth and a new value Gettier problem
3. Solving the new value Gettier problem


Morals of the Value Problems
----------------------------
1. Truth plus a reliable source of truth cannot explain knowledge.
    - Reliabalism has a particular diffucult time dealing with the value problem
        * Reliablism
        * Espresso Machine --> Espresso
        * Traits/Cognitive Activity --> True Belief
2. Truth plus an independently valuable source cannot explain the value of knowledge
    - If we use the machine product model, doesn't always give use results we want
        * Disconnect between product and the source
    - In order to correctly address the value problem - must abandon the machine-product model
3. Knowing is related to the knower not as product to machine but as act to agent
    - Agent --> Action
    - Agent --> True Belief
    - Reliablity is not good indpendent of reverything else
        * Nothing specially valuable about reliability
    - Something valuable about cause or source of TB does not necessarily help value of K
    - Source (intrinsicly valuable) ---- casual relation --> TB

- Connection between knower and knowledge is too weak
    * Belief is related to the knower as the product is to a machine
        - Need to tighten this connection
    * Knower -> Belief
        - Agent (Goodness or badness of motives) ---(some logical connection / not casual )--> Act (Goodness or badness of act)
    * Beliefs are motivated true beliefs become knowledge by having the right motivation
    * Love of Truth is the telos
        - K = TB from love of truth
        - Value of K = Value of TB + value of love of truth
    * Beliefs are motivated in sense that 
- Value of Love of Truth
    1. Possibility of moral praise & blame
        - Blame: 
    2. True beliefs are valuable as means to our ends
        - So love of truth is valuable as means to practical ends.

The Value of Truth and a New Value Gettier Problem
---------------------------------------------------
- Two parts of Knwoledge
    * Based in a love of truth = Admirable
    * Constituted in part by a true belief = Desirable
- New Gettier Probelm
    * Admirable but not desirable belief
        - Leaves on the tree
    * Lucky is admirable but not desirable
    * Most valueable is admirable and desirable
- Value Scale
    * A & D = Most Valuable
    * (A & ~D) || (~A & D) = Less Valuable
    * ~A & ~D = Least Valuable
- But What if A&D is accidental, well formed belief on important topic
    * But well formed belief on desirable topic formation is accidental
