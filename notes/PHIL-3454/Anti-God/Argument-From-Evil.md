Argument From Evil
==================

The Argument
-------------
1. If God exists, he is omniscient
2. If God exists, he is omnipotent
3. If God exists, he is omni-benevolent
4. An omniscient being knows of any evils
5. An omnipotent being can prevent any evil
6. An omni-benevolent being stops any evil it knows about, so far as it can 
7. So, if God exists, he stops all evil so that evil does not exist [by the preceding]
8. Evil exists
9. So, 3Os God does not. [by (7), (8)]

    * "It's all good." Evil is an illusion
    * Evil may be a strong term, but sufferring is pretty   
    * Undenidbale: Rape, Tay-Sachs syndrome, stubbing your toe
- Also
    * [Mackie] If evil is an illusion, *this illusion* would nevertheless seem to be an evil
- Against (6)
    * "The world si better off with some evil" If evil is ultimatly beneficial, then a perfectly good being may not want to eliminate it

The Challenge
=============
- Why believe that? Maybe the world is

- The Free Will Defense [Descares, Plantinga]
    * It is better for us to have freewill than not.  BUt unfortunatly free-will causes evil
    * But [Macke] Freedom of action is not necessarily good. It is good to stop criminals from freely committing crimes
    * Regardless, the criminal still freely chose to attempt the crime. So maybe free choice is the important thing.
    * Reply 0:
        - But Freedom of *action* is what causes evil. But freedom of action is not necessarily good, so it wustify the xistence of evil.
        - Counter Reply: Maybe freedom of action is needed for free choice. If so, the existence of free choice leads to the existence of evil 

        - Regardless the criminal still freely chose to attempt the crime. So maybe free choice is the important thing.

        - Counter-Reply: Freedom of action is needed for free choice. (In what sense are you 

        - Counter-Counter-Reply: [Macke] Suppose we naturally wanted what's good, so we always chose what's right.
            * Perhaps our choices would not be free in some sense, but why is our evil-filled world preferable?
    * Reply 2:
        - Some evils are not due to free choice
        - e.g congenital disesase, natural disasters ("acts of God!")
        - Plantinga suggests these may be due to a devil
        - But why would God allow the devil to exist?
        * Counter-Reply: These are punishments for earlier misdeeds/
- An airtight theism?
    * Evil is **necessary** for some greater good
    * It is nonsense to say God could have skipped evil for that
    * God is omnipotent - meaning she can do anything **possible**
    * Plus a lil' Faith

- Rejoinder: [Leibniz] This is the best of all possible worlds.
    * And it is *impossible* to have the greater good w/o evil:
        - It is *impossible* to be free if God stops misbehaviing
        - It is *impossible* to exhibit virtue if there is no evil.

- [Hick] The Purpose of Evil is "Soul Building"
- Against (6)
    * ReplY: Yet then God is not a personal God
        - DOes it make sense to worship him/her?
    * Reply 2: There are objective features about humans that makes them importatnly different from ants

- Aspects
    * Evil is necessary for a greater good (FW, Bad Ass, Virtue)
    * Omnipotentece means able to do anything possible
    * SO: This is the best world possible
        - Plus a lil' faith
