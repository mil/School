Argument From Evil
==================
- An airtight theism?
    * Evil is **necessary** for some greater good
    * It is nonsense to say God could have skipped evil for that
    * God is omnipotent - meaning she can do anything **possible**
    * Plus a lil' Faith

- Rejoinder: [Leibniz] This is the best of all possible worlds.
    * And it is *impossible* to have the greater good w/o evil:
        - It is *impossible* to be free if God stops misbehaviing
        - It is *impossible* to exhibit virtue if there is no evil.

- [Hick] The Purpose of Evil is "Soul Building"
- Against (6)
    * ReplY: Yet then God is not a personal God
        - DOes it make sense to worship him/her?
    * Reply 2: There are objective features about humans that makes them importatnly different from ants

- Aspects
    * Evil is necessary for a greater good (FW, Bad Ass, Virtue)
    * Omnipotentece means able to do anything possible
    * SO: This is the best world possible
        - Plus a lil' faith
