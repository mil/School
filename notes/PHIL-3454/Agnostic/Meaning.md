Religion and the "Meaning of Life"
==================================
- **An Argument for Nihilism**
    1. x is valuable.   [Assume for *reductio*]
    2. If x is valuable, then some y makes it valuable.
    3. y can make x valuable if and only if y is itself valuable .
    4. Nothing can explain its own value.
    5. So, if x is valuable, then some other valuable thing y makes it valuable. [From 2-4]
    6. So, if y is valuable, then some valuable third thing, z makes it valuable. [From 5]
    7. So, if z is valuable, then some valuable fourth thing...
        - [ A Regress Ensues ]
    8. So, x is not valuable. [By reductio]
    9. Thus, humanity/pleasure/my life is not valuable.
- **Lois Hope Walker's Response**
    * Premise 4 is false.
        - Something can explain its own value.
        - God is the exception to premise 4.
        - God creates his own value 
            * (And since God is omnipotent, he can do that)
    * Reply (Attributed to Nietzsche, by LHW)
        - (10) Freedom is more important than for life to be valuable.
        - (11) Religion compromises freedom.
        - (12) So, even if religion makes life valuable, we should not be religious
    * Against (10)
        - Freedom is always freedom to pursue some goal/purpose.
            * So the value of freedom dervices from the value of a purpose
        - People sacrifice freedom for purpose or meaning, e.g. martyrdom.
            * It seems at least some of these acts are rational.
    * Against (11)
        - Freedom is enhanced by knowing truths
        - And religion purports to give us important truths about the universe
    * More Positive Affects
        1. There is a rationale for our existence.
        2. God will prevail.
- **The Circularity Objection Generalized**
    * Let e be the ultimate explanation for what makes x valuable
    * E.g. e could be the fact that "x is willed by God", "x is endorsed by natural law", "x maximizes human well-being", etc...
    * **Another Nihilist Argument**
        1. If x is valuable, then x is ultimatly valuable because of e.
        2. e makes x valuable only if e is itself valuable.
        3. If e is valuable, then e is ultimatly valuable because of e. [From (1)-(2)]
        4. Nothing can explain its own value.
        5. So, x is not valuable [From the preceding]
        6. So humanity/pleasure/my life is not valuable [From (5)]
