Religion and the "Meaning of Life"
==================================
- **An Argument for Nihilism**
    1. x is valuable.   [Assume for *reductio*]
    2. If x is valuable, then some y makes it valuable.
    3. y can make x valuable if and only if y is itself valuable .
    4. Nothing can explain its own value.
    5. So, if x is valuable, then some other valuable thing y makes it valuable. [From 2-4]
    6. So, if y is valuable, then some valuable third thing, z makes it valuable. [From 5]
    7. So, if z is valuable, then some valuable fourth thing...
        - [ A Regress Ensues ]
    8. So, x is not valuable. [By reductio]
    9. Thus, humanity/pleasure/my life is not valuable.
- **Lois Hope Walker's Response**
    * Premise 4 is false.
        - Something can explain its own value.
        - God is the exception to premise 4.
        - God creates his own value 
            * (And since God is omnipotent, he can do that)
    * Reply (Attributed to Nietzsche, by LHW)
        - (10) Freedom is more important than for life to be valuable.
        - (11) Religion compromises freedom.
        - (12) So, even if religion makes life valuable, we should not be religious
    * Against (10)
        - Freedom is always freedom to pursue some goal/purpose.
            * So the value of freedom dervices from the value of a purpose
        - People sacrifice freedom for purpose or meaning, e.g. martyrdom.
            * It seems at least some of these acts are rational.
    * Against (11)
        - Freedom is enhanced by knowing truths
        - And religion purports to give us important truths about the universe
    * More Positive Affects - **Other Advantages of (Some Religions)**
        1. There is a rationale for our existence.
        2. Good will prevail.
        3. God loves and care for us.
        4. It is in one's own interest to be good.
        5. Justice reigns in the universe.
        6. All persons are of equal worth.
        7. We can be liberated from guilt by divine forgiveness.
        8. There is life after death.
    * Replies:
        - (2) may bread apathy about working to improve the world.
        - (3) and (7)  may bread apathy about self-improvement.
        - (4) and (5) instill fear, potentionally on a false pretense.
        - The Humanist can have reasons for accepting (6).
        - (8) may not be desirable.
- **The Circularity Objection Generalized**
    * Let e be the ultimate explanation for what makes x valuable
    * E.g. e could be the fact that "x is willed by God", "x is endorsed by natural law", "x maximizes human well-being", etc...
    * **Another Nihilist Argument**
        1. If x is valuable, then x is ultimatly valuable because of e.
        2. e makes x valuable only if e is itself valuable.
        3. If e is valuable, then e is ultimatly valuable because of e. [From (1)-(2)]
        4. Nothing can explain its own value.
        5. So, x is not valuable [From the preceding]
        6. So humanity/pleasure/my life is not valuable [From (5)]
- **Nietzsche's Solutions**
    * Suppose e = "x is what I will to be valuable." 
        - Then I am the source of all value.
