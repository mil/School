Nietzsche
=========
- Objection 4.1:
    * Nietzsche is a relativist, and makes morality a "free-for-all".
    * What's right for you may be wrong for me, and there are not objective values to determine who's right.
- Objection 4.2:
    * Relatedly, debate about morality just becomes a battle of wills, not an inquiry into what is truly right or wrong.
    * Reply: ALl this assumes it is better to have an objective standard
        - And better if moral debate is not just a battle of wills. But why?
- Two possible answers:
    * Threat of social disorder?
        - Neitzsche denies that moral relavitivlsm will bring total social chaos.
        - We are naturally herd animals
            * (and even Ubermenchen will share some values, due to evolutionally conditioned instincts).
    * A desire for peace/harmony?
        - Neitzsche rejects this jUdeo-Christial Ideas (Heard MOrality)
        - It is during conflict where ture virtues manifest.
        - So a world of battles is a btter world than one of unwavering tranquility
    * Follow up Objection:
        * Isn't Neitzsche sasuming that his ideals are objectivly right, and other values are objectivly wrong?

    * No - he wnats to imporse his subjective values on us!! But it is not mere bullying. He is using the shared value of reason to convert us
        - Arguing that our value-systems are inconsistnet. So if we value reason, he thinks his moral-ssytem is better by our own light

Nietzsche's Crituqe of Judeo-Christian Morality [JCM]
-----------------------------------------------------
1. JCM is inconsistent with the motives behind it:
    - JCM originates in resentment:
        * Under roman rule, the juewish people represented being 2nd class citizens and so they devalued the power and strength of the romans
    - JCM resulted from a desired for power among Jewish peoples. They saw themselves as morally superier to the romans, so to gain a kind of moral supremacy over them
    - Often, people who accept JCM do so for selfish reasons, E.g the weak value altruism since they ultimatly benefit from it. Yet this selfishness is inconsistent with altruism!
2. JCM is harmful to humanity, contradicting the value of human flourishing. JCM devaules virtues of strength, e.g. pride, sperier intelligence, etc.
    * Instead virtues of weakness are encouraged (humility, uncodntiional love)
3. JCM is life-denying because:
