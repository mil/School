Nietzsche
=========
- Objection 4.1:
    * Nietzsche is a relativist, and makes morality a "free-for-all".
    * What's right for you may be wrong for me, and there are not objective values to determine who's right.
- Objection 4.2:
    * Relatedly, debate about morality just becomes a battle of wills, not an inquiry into what is truly right or wrong.
    * Reply: ALl this assumes it is better to have an objective standard
        - And better if moral debate is not just a battle of wills. But why?
- Two possible answers:
    * Threat of social disorder?
        - Neitzsche denies that moral relavitivlsm will bring total social chaos.
        - We are naturally herd animals
            * (and even Ubermenchen will share some values, due to evolutionally conditioned instincts).
    * A desire for peace/harmony?
        - Neitzsche rejects this jUdeo-Christial Ideas (Heard MOrality)
        - It is during conflict where ture virtues manifest.
        - So a world of battles is a btter world than one of unwavering tranquility
    * Follow up Objection:
        * Isn't Neitzsche sasuming that his ideals are objectivly right, and other values are objectivly wrong?

    * No - he wnats to imporse his subjective values on us!! But it is not mere bullying. He is using the shared value of reason to convert us
        - Arguing that our value-systems are inconsistnet. So if we value reason, he thinks his moral-ssytem is better by our own light

Nietzsche's Crituqe of Judeo-Christian Morality [JCM]
-----------------------------------------------------
1. JCM is inconsistent with the motives behind it:
    - JCM originates in resentment:
        * Under roman rule, the juewish people represented being 2nd class citizens and so they devalued the power and strength of the romans
    - JCM resulted from a desired for power among Jewish peoples. They saw themselves as morally superier to the romans, so to gain a kind of moral supremacy over them
    - Often, people who accept JCM do so for selfish reasons, E.g the weak value altruism since they ultimatly benefit from it. Yet this selfishness is inconsistent with altruism!
2. JCM is harmful to humanity, contradicting the value of human flourishing. JCM devaules virtues of strength, e.g. pride, sperier intelligence, etc.
    * Instead virtues of weakness are encouraged (humility, uncodntiional love)
3. JCM is life-denying because:
    - JCM devaules this world in favor of some (imaginary?) spiritual world.
    - JCM wants us to resist our natural insticts by cultivating weakness. Since these instincts areessential to what we are
        * JCM demands that we devalue ourselves.
    - JCM rejects suffering, which is an inevitable part of life
        * Neitzsche's attitude: What doesn't kill me makes me stronger.

Objections to Nietzsche
=======================
1. Nietzsche was a misogynist, and tended to assume that everyone was heterosexual.
2. Nietzsche was a racist against Jews.
    - Geneology of morals, 3rd essay
    - Reply: He lambasted Jews for cultural reasons, not ethnic reasons. It was his sister Elizabith who encouraged Fasicsts to misinterpret Nietzsche as Anti-Semetic (See sections 348 and espcially 377)
3. Why think that this much evil makes for the best type of world? Woudln't the world be better without some of its evils? (Tsunami in Japan, stubbing your toe) [Cf. Hume against Leibniz]
    - ALso, Nietzsche is not describing the world here as much as prescribing the healthiest attitude toward the world. *Amour fati*.
4. Master-morality does not make sense for us *herd animals*. A would-be Ubermench would only get kicked out of the herd.
    - Reply 1: That may be strictly correct, but the species ought to evolove into master-morality. Masimize human potentiontial.
        * Counter-reply: QUestion-begging. Why is it better for us to evolve away from the herd? IN fact, some connection to the herd may be for the best (Together we are stronger. And our lives are are richer when we bond with each other.)
    - Reply 2: Nietzsche wasn't writing to the herd:
        * "IT would be a complete contradiction of myself were I to already expect ears and hands for my truths todady: that no one hears me todays, that no one knows how to take me today, is not only understandable, it even seems the right thing to me.". --Ecce Homo
        * He is rather trying to prevent future master-types from sacrificing themselves to herd-morality.
