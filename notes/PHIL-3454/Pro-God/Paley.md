The Teleological Argument
=========================
- AKA the **Argument from Design**
- Two Versions: **Naive** & **Paley**

Naive Version
=============
1. The **universe** exhibits a **complex order/design**
2. When there is a **complex design, there is a designer**
3. So, the **universe has a designer** (from 1-2)
4. The **designer of the universe** would be **God**
5. Therefore: **God Exists** (from 3-4) 

- *Problem*: Doubt about 2
    * Re: **Evolved Design**

Paley's Version
===============
If you have a wind up watch, gears working in a particular way

1. **Human artifacts** (e.g., a watch) have a **design** that is due to an **intelligent designer**
2. The **universe's design** is **like** the design of these **artifacts**
    - (in that the order of the parts is orchestrated)
3. So, the **universe** (more likely than not) **has an intelligent designer**
    - (by analogy 1-2)
4. But **creating** and implementing the **design of the universe** would require **god-like powers**
5. So, there is (more likely than not) **a designer with god-like powers**
    - (from 3-4)
6. Therefore, **some kind of God** (more likely than not) **exists**
    - (from 5)


But is this a **Divine** being?

Hume's Objections
=================
- The **analogy** between a watch and the universe is **tenuous**
    * ...after all, there are **many ways** in which a **watch does NOT resemble the universe**
- *Reply* (Swinburne) You wouldn't expect the universe's complex designs to come from **randomness**
- *Hume's Rejoinder*: How is that **expectation justified?** The origin of the universe is quite a unique affair which we know very little about
- *Reply*: (Paley) Like the universe...
    * I have never seen a watch being designed.
    * Nor has anyone very *said* to me that watches are designed.
    * I also know very little about how watches are design and created
