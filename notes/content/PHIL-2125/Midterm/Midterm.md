1. Be able to describe the axiomatic method in philosophy, as we discussed it in class, and how it works. (Looking it up on the internet is not enough, you need the in-class notes.)
    * The Axomatic Method:
        - Defintions
        - Rules of Inference
        - Draw Conclusions
    * This is largely convetional

2. Know the definitions of all the key terms we discussed in class, for Leibniz and for Locke. (What was written on the left hand side of the board, or what was on the projector.) Also, know how each principle or claim is justified. For instance, for the Principle of Sufficient Reason, why does Leibniz think this principle is (1) justified and (2) a priori? This will not be the question, but related ones may be.

3. Review the definitions of different philosophical movements (especially empiricism and rationalism) in the Anthony Kenny book, as well as the descriptions of philosophers and their views, specifically Locke and Leibniz.

4. What is the significance of primary truths, for Leibniz? What role do they play in his system? Be able to describe this and to explain how the system works.

5. Why does Leibniz think primary truths can be justified a priori? How does he define a priori?
    - Primary Truths are those truths about the way the mind works independent of any emprical given
    - These are laws about how our mind works
    - Axiomatics & Basics of the system of Knowledge
    - Examples
        * A = A
        * A != ~A
    

6. How does Leibniz define necessary truth? What is the account he gives of why truths can be necessary?
    - Necessary Truths are primary truths which Be

7. What are the main reasons Boyle gives for why the “mechanist” or “corpuscularian” philosophy should be accepted? Be able to explain these, not just list them.

8. Know all the key terms for Boyle as well.

9. What is the difference between Boyle’s theory and the Epicurean theory?
    - Epicurean Theory:
        * Atoms swering in the void randomly
        * Accidently produce all phenomenon of the universe
    - Boyle's Theory (Corpusles -- Mechanism):
        * Distinguish between first origin & subsequent course
            - First origin caused by God
            - Gave motion to matter
            - 

10. What is the main objection to corpuscularianism that Boyle describes? Why does he think it fails as an objection?
    - Objection to Copusculariainism
        * Chemists deduce complete natural philosophy from salt, sulfure, mecurcy, etc....
    - Reply:
        * The chemical ingredients owe their nature and other qualities to union of insensible particles
        * All of the chemicals properties are mechanical propties of corpuscles

    

11. What are the three elements of Locke’s philosophical method?
    1. "Inquire into the origin of those ideas... which a man observes and is consious to himself he ahs in mind" (317). Notice that this "origin" cannot be a phsyical origin, that is, this is not empirical psychology (see above)
    2. "Inquire what knowledge th understanding has by those ideas, and the certainty, evidence, and extent of it" (317)
    3. "Make some inquiry into the nature and ground of faith and opinion" (317)
12. Know Locke’s main arguments in support of the “tabula rasa” view, and the main objections to that view that he considers and rejects.
    - Tabula Rosa
        * Basic idea is that there are no innate ideas but rather our mind is initially tabula rasa at birth
        * We form ideas based on our senses via perception..
    - Main Objections
        * Innate Ideas
            - **Argument**
                * * It is possible to "attain all the knowledge they have" without appealing to innate ideas.
            - **Reply**: 
                * If we have sight and power to "recieve" color information from objects
                * Why would we need an innate idea of color?
        * General Assent
            - **Argument**
                * People assent "universal" to all sorts of principles & ideas. 
                * There is a widespread agreement to principles
                    - This wouldn't be the case if we were just randomly acquiring information about the world around us 
            - **Response**
                * The world is the same world for everyone
                    - Thus, it is no suprise that people agree on "universals"
                * Further, there are no true universal argument
                    - When you investigate other cultures for instance
        * Age of Reason
            - There is such thing as the "age of reason" -- children attain knowledge of innate ideas
            - Even if there were a time when children realized "reason", they would need to have acquired these "innate" truths somehow.
            - Reason alone cannot make these inferences
            - Reason only provides the faculties to go from one deduction to the next
