Course Description:
This course is designed to examine a range the fundamental questions in epistemology.
We will begin by getting acquainted with three core, traditional questions: What is
knowledge? What is it to be justified to believe something? What is the structure of
justification? After considering some of the most influential answers to these questions
we will examine some topics that are gaining popularity in contemporary epistemology:
what is the nature of epistemic value? What, if any, is the distinct value of knowledge?
What, if any, is the distinct nature of the epistemic ‘ought’? Finally, we will close by
examining some self-described attempts to turn epistemology on its head. How far can
and should epistemology be psychologized? How far, and in what sense, can and
should the subjects of epistemology by studied as natural sciences study natural
phenomena?
Required Texts:
Arguing About Knowledge, edited by Ram Neta and Duncan Pritchard. Routledge,
2009. ISBN: 978-0-415-44839-0
Course Work
Your grade in this course will be determined by four components:
Undergraduate students:
1. Exams (50%). There will be two exams in this course, one mid term (15%) and one
final exam (35%). The exams will consist in in-class essays.
2. Participation (10%). Your participation grade will be determined by both your
attendance and your participation in class discussions.
3. Class presentation (10%) and paper (30%). Each undergraduate will be required to
make one brief (15 minute) presentation during the course of the semester and write
a paper (15 pages) associated with that presentation. Details of this assignment will
be discussed in class and posted on Scholar. The written portion of the assignment
will involve a proposal (to be completed before your presentation), a rough draft, and
a final draft (due at the beginning of the final exam).
Graduate students:
1. Final Exam (20%) The exam will consist in in-class essays.2. Participation (10%). Your participation grade will be determined by both your
attendance and your participation in class discussions.
3. Lead discussion (25%). Each graduate student will have the opportunity to lead the
class discussion of one of the assigned reading students (or an alternative reading
selected by the graduate student in consultation with the instructor). You will have full
responsibility for the class while leading discussion. This could last anywhere from
half of a class period to an entire class period depending on the reading you choose.
After we select dates, you must schedule a meeting with me at least one week prior
to your selected date. At the meeting we can talk about your lesson plan.
4. Paper (45%). You are free to choose the topic for your paper but it must be in
epistemology. It need not be directly addressed to any of the particular readings we
cover in class, however. Your paper should be around 20 double-spaced pages. You
will need to submit a proposal, rough draft, and final draft. The final draft is due by the
beginning of the final exam.
A detailed explanation of how you can expect your work to be graded in this course can
be found on Scholar. Scholar will also provide links to resources inside and outside of
the university to aid your research and writing for this course.
All written work will be returned to you with comments (when appropriate) and grade
(when appropriate) within ten days of submission.
All written work must be submitted through Scholar. Hard copies and email submissions
will not be accepted.
Honor Code:
The Honor System will be strictly enforced in this class. It is your responsibility to know
and understand the code and to know what does and does not constitute plagiarism. If
you have any questions on this matter please see me before turning in the assignment.
Any suspected violations of the Honor System will be immediately reported.

attention deficit disorder, psychological, physical, etc.), if you have emergency medical
information to share with me, or if you need special arrangements in case the building
must be evacuated, please make an appointment with me as soon as possible.
Course Schedule:
