Ontology and Epistemology
=========================
- Ontology
    * Study of the nature of being, existence, or reality
    * What is there?
    * Particularly for Berekly
- Epistemology
    * Study of knowledge
    * How do we know about it?

Philonous versus Hylas
======================
- Philonous
    * Berkely's Idealism
        - The unltimate ontology is only ideas rather than motional/physical substance
        - Ideals is not a shallow term
-Hylas
    * Anything other than materialsim
    * Accepts material substances
