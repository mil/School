Fransico Suarez -- Metaphysics
===============================
- Metaphysics 
    * "Studies being qua being" (181).
    * Being as being

- Substances and Accident
    * Substance: 
        - "things like stars and dogs and pebbles which subsist on their own"
    * Accident: 
        - "entities likes brightness, fierceness, and hardness which exists only by inhering in substances and have no independent history"
- Matter and Form
    * Matter
        - The material that makes up a thing.
    * Form
        - The design of the thing. So, a statue is made out of stone (matter)
        - But is is made according to a design or plan (form)
- Real Being vs Entia Rationis
    * Real Being: Both substances and accidents
    * Entia Rationis: Creations of reason
        1. Abscens of something (absence of sight, absence of sight, absence of money = poverty, etc.)
        2. Relationships ("uncle of", "taller than")
        3. Creates of the imaginations: chimeras and hippogriffs (and Harry Potter)
- Essence vs Esse
    * Essence: Either a generic essence or an individual essence
        - ("dog" is a gneeric one, "Rover is an individual one).
    * Esse: Either "existence" or "being in general" (182).
- One way to read this: If "essence" is epxressed with concepts like "dog", and "esse" is "exististence", then knowledg eof essence answers the question "What is a dog?" and knowledg eof existence answers the queswtion "are there any dogs?"
- What are the other ways to read this distniction?

Principles of Individuation
---------------------------
- Thomas Acquinas:
    * Principle of individuation is matter. So what makes Peter an "individual" is his being a human, not his being this human. In other words, Peter has no extra proeprty that sorts him as an individual, beyond human. (In even more works, Peter is not a speicla snowflake: he is just like all the other snowflakes, he just is made of different material).
- Jon Duns Scotus
    * Peter also possesses "thisness" or "haecceitas". THis is like a pointer that point to Peter as this human, not just any human.
- Fransico Suraez
    * Peter has a formal principle, a "differntia invidiualis", that makes him Peter and not anyone else (all, p.183)

- What's intersting about Suarez. Older philosophiers talked about matter and form but Suarez added this idea that there is something that makes a real being a substance, not an accident (184).

- Substance and Accident
    * Substance: "things like stars and dogs and pabbles which subsist on their own"
    * Accident: "entities like brightness, fierceness, and hardness which exist only by inhering in substances and have no independent history" (181).
