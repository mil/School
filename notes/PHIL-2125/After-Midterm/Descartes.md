Rene Descartes
==============
- External Truths
    * "For Descartes these truths were creates, distinct from God, brought into existence from all eternity by His creative power" (185).
    * "were not truths about material objects: theorems about triangles could be proved even if there was not a single triangular object in existence, and geometry held true even if the external world was a complete illusion" (185)
    * "prior to, and independent of, any human minds, and thugh thjey were dependent on, they were distinct from, the mind of God" (185)
- Substance
    * Aristotelians
        - "there were many different kinds of substances, each specified by a different substaintial form" (188)
        - So gold is a substance, animal is a substance and so forth
        - "When I look at a piece of gold, I am genuiently seeing a substance though only science can tell me what gold really is" (188)
    * Descartes
        - "there were only two kinds of substance: mind, or thinking substance, mind, or thinking substance, and body, or extended substance [...] the essence of mind was thught and the essence of body was extension" (188).
        - "Susbtances are not perceptible by the sense -- not only thei runderlying nature, but their very existence, is something to be established only by intellecxtual inference" (188).
    * Locke
        - Real vs Nominal essences (189)
        - Susbstances have nominal essences that we can know, buthe thier real essences are hidden
    * Kenny
        - "it seems incrible that someone should argue that substances has no properties preciscely beacuse it is what has the properties" (189-190)
        - "IN the Aristotelian tradition there was no such tihng as propertyless substance, a something that could be identified as a particular individual without reference to any sortal. Fido is identifiable individual only so long as he remains a dog, as log as the sortal "dog" can truly be applied to him" (190)
