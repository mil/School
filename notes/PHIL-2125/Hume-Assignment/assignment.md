Hume assignment 
60 points, 20 per question 

To answer, you can simply copy and paste these questions from here into the answer box, and then type in your answers. 

Give a short essay length answer to all of the following questions. You can use class notes, or the texts. No need to cite the texts if you use class notes. NOTE: These answers will be longer than the ones on the Metaphysics or Berkeley assignments!

1.	What is the difference between an impression and an idea, for David Hume? Explain your answer, and give at least one concrete (everyday, specific) example of an impression and an idea. 
2.	Hume expresses doubts about the necessity and universality of causal relationships in the passages we read from the Enquiry. Does he think that we do have a justification, that is, some reason for, our causal beliefs? What is that justification? 
3.	Does Hume think it is possible that causal relationships are real, or not? Why - you need to explain your answer.
