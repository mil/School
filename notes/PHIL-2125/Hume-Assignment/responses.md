1.	What is the difference between an impression and an idea, for David Hume? Explain your answer, and give at least one concrete (everyday, specific) example of an impression and an idea. 

Hume makes a clear distinction between impressions and ideas. For Hume, an impression is the immediate sensation of the event or experience. For example, if you were to put your hand in a fire, you would feels the burning sensation at that moment. Impressions are instantaneous and the mind has no control over impressions. You cannot prevent yourself from feeling your hand being incredibly hot while it is burning in the fire. Impressions are quite vivid, intense, and take effect instantaneously. Any sort of sensory experience that a human could experience including: touch, smell, taste, sound, and so on and so forth could readily be called an impression at time of affect.

Ideas, in comparison, are quite different. Ideas are the mere reflections on prior impressions. What this means is any time you reflect, think back, or remember a prior impression, this is an idea. For example, after you put your hand in the fire, you can later reflect on that event. You can think back to how hot your hand felt and how intense the pain may have been. This reflection is the idea. However, regardless of how much your idea may epitomize the impression, the idea itself can never meet the magnitude of the impression itself. You can't put yourself in a flashback state where you feel an idea that puts forth the same vivacity of an impression itself. Reflecting on the idea of your hand burning in the fire will never be quite the same as the impression of your hand actually burning in the fire.

However, unlike impressions, ideas may be combined to form new "creative" ideas. For example, unicorns may not exist in our world and we may be unable to ever receive a direct impression of a unicorn as it walks by us. However, we could combine ideas we have of horses and spiraling horns to create the idea of a unicorn in our mind. Thus, through the combination of ideas (originated from impressions), we can fabricate many new ideas completely unlike direct ideas formed originally from impressions.

2.	Hume expresses doubts about the necessity and universality of causal relationships in the passages we read from the Enquiry. Does he think that we do have a justification, that is, some reason for, our causal beliefs? What is that justification? 

Hume believes that there is not necessity or universality of causal relationships. Whenever we experience or form impressions of a cause and an effect, there is nothing that logically links those two events together. For example, although we observe the sun rise each and every morning, this does not necessitate that the sun will rise tomorrow. All we can say about the sun rising tomorrow is that we have seen the sun rise each day so far, so it seems likely that the sun will rise tomorrow.

Consider if the world had just been created and you knew not of any sun rising. Hume would say that that embedded in the existence of the solar system, or even further in the astronomy or physics that supports the sun rising each morning is not embedded the casual relation that the sun actually will rise. We can only speculate on the casual relation a posteriori by noticing the sun has rose in the past. In the world where the sun has never rose, how can we possibly say the sun will necessarily rise.  Before the event or the cause actually occurs once, we can say nothing of the expected effect. Thus, our justification for our casual beliefs is merely a posteriori knowledge. We can only derive justification of cause and effect by observing such relation a posteriori.

3.	Does Hume think it is possible that causal relationships are real, or not? Why - you need to explain your answer. 

This largely depends on the sense in which "real" is referred to. For Hume, casual relationships are "real" in the sense that we can empirically observe the cause-effect relation, however independent from that relation it seems not to exist. We cannot speculate merely within our own ideas that causal relationships are real, independent of experience. However, given that we are unable to be detached from experience all together, these are real because all we do is form impressions and act on those impressions in any case. So how are causal relation any less real than anything else in the world since we are attached to this empirical machine at all times. Everything we do or think is supervened by this problem of empirical knowledge. In this sense, Hume might say that casual relations are as "real" as they could be.

However, in another sense, Hume might say casual relationships are not "real". Unlike mathematical and logical truths, casual relations cannot transcend experience. Logical and mathematical truths like 2+2=4, or A=A seem to hold regardless or independent of experience. I can solve mathematical proofs in my head all day long and so long as I made the proper deductions, my solutions would necessarily be correct. This is different from me speculating on the casual relation that the sun will rise tomorrow just because it did yesterday. In this sense, mathematical and logical truths are more "real" or true than casual relationships.  Thus, whether casual relationships are real or not largely depends on how Hume might define "real".
