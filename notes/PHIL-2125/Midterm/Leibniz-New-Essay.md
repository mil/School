Leibniz
=======
= Rationalist but no a Cartesian/Platnic idealist
- Innate  principles/characteristic of the subject.
- Argument
    1. The sense only give us singular experiences (particular instances)
    2. We will never observe all instanes of a thing
    3. Just because the instances wei've observed are one way doesn't mean they logically couldn't be different
        * (=> it doesn't mean they're that way **necessarily**)
    4.  The senses are necessary to but not sufficeint for knowledge of universal and necessary truths.
- Therefore: Experience is not enough for knowledge of universla truths
    * Leibnize thinks this is the knowledge (universal truths)
