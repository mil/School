Introduction to Cognitive Psychology
====================================
- **What is Cognitive Psychologists?**
    * Study of how People
        - **Percieve** , **Learn**, **Remember**
        - **Think** about **Information**
    * Involves a Variety of **Mental Processes**
        - Memory, Attention, Language, Problem Solving
        - Decision Making, Reading
    * **Cognition**: People Think
    * **Cognitive Psychology**: Scientists think about how people think
- **Dialectic Progression** of Ideas
    * **Thesis**
        - **Statement** of **Opinion** or **Belief**
        - e.g: "Biology determines human nature" (_Early 20th Century_ View)
    * **Antithesis** (Anti-thesis)
        - **Counterstatement**: **counters** a previous statement of belief
        - e.g: "The enviroment determines human nature" (_1960s_ View)
    * **Synthesis**
        - **Integrates** most **Credible Features** of **Thesis and Antithesis **
            * (Best of Both Views)
        - e.g: "Nature and nurture _interact_ to determine human nature" (_Modern View_)
- **Roots of (Cognitive) Psychology**
    * A _teacher_ and his _student_ **disagree**...
    * **Rationalism** (Plato)
        - _Logic & Reasoning_ is Key to knowledge/truth
        - **Philosophy**: Introspection and reasoning
        - **Descartes**
            * Cogito, ergo sum
            * Senses can decieve. 
            * Knowledge comes from Reason & Math
    * **Empiricism** (Aristotle)
        - _Experience & Observation_ is Key
        - **Physiology***: Emperical study of body functions
        - **Locke**
            * Knowledge comes from sensory experience (evidence)
            * "Tabula Rosa" -- Blank Slate
    * **Synthesis** is called: **Transcendental Idealism**
        - **Kant**'s modern view
        - Reason without experience is empty, devoid of any content
            * And yet experience without reason and thought is blind
        - **Both experience & reason have a role**
- **Other Roots of (Cognitive) Psychology**
    * **Strucuralism**
        - Wundt & Tichener
        - "Elements" of the mind
        - 1st major school of thought in psychology
        - Classify structures (content) of the mind (sesnsations, thoughts), how they interact
        - **Introspection**
            * Think aloud, empericst method
    * **Functionalism**
        - James & Dewey
        - "Process" (vs. content of mind)
        - What we do with the mind, how, and why
        - Pragmatisim 
        - But didn't specify how learning happens
    * **Synthesis**: Associationism
        - How events/ideas become associated with one another in the mind via learning
        - **Aristotle**
            * Contiguity (close in time)
            * Similarity (similar features)
            * Contract (polarity, e.g hot/cold, day/night)
        - **Ebbinghaus**
            * Use Self-Observation
                - (Memory for nonsense syllables, RT & errors)
            * Study of learning by rehersa
                - (Concious repetition)
        - **Thorndike**
            * Law of Effect
                - We learn "effects" (volunrary responses)
                - via "satifsfactions" (rewards)
                - (e.g. soling math problems for treats)
- **Association and Behaviorism**
    * **Associationism**
        - (Thorndike)
        - Satisfaction/Law of Effect
    * **Behaviorism**
        - (Pavlov)
        - "Contingency"
        - Extreme associasism (enviro-behavior)
        - Make presence of food (US) contigent on presence of bell (CS) -> CR
        - Classical Conditiong - Involuntary learning
        - Contiguit (temporal) + contigency (US with cS)
    * **Synthesis**: Radical Behaviorism
        - We can only observe and thus study the enciroment (input)
        - and behavior (output), non unobservable mental processes (mind = the black box)
        - Watson: "Give me 12 Infants", Little Albert
- **Experimental Studies**
    * Random sample of participants
    * Manipulate the **independent** variable (IV)
        - Create **experiemntal** group & a **control** group
    * **Randomly assign** participants
    - Measure the **dependent** variable (DV)
    - Control all other variables
- **Typical Dependent Varibales**
    * Reaction Time (milliseconds)
        - Mental events take time
    * Accuracy/Error Analysis
        - How well the participant does on a task
    * What trade off occurs between these variables?
        - What happens to your error rate if you go too fast?
- Correlational Studies
    * Simply measure 2 (or more) variables of interest and calculate correlation.
        - Does X relate to Y? If so, _how_?
            * Most common: Pearson product-moment r (actually developed by Francis Galton)
                - Example: x = test anxiety, y = text scores (exam performance)
    * Direction of relationship: **sign** of "r"
        - What does positive vs. negative look like?
    * Strength of (linear) relationship: **size** of "r"
        - What does strong vs. weak look like?
        - Meaning if **signifigant** (p < .05)?
    * Limitation : Correlation does not imply causation!
    * Casual Directionality: Does Delta X lead to Delta Y, or Delta Y to Delta X?
        - There is no IV and DV
    * Third Variable Problem & Spurious Correlation
        - Confound: Unmeasured variable affects rxv
            * E.g Z = time spent revising answers
            * Z may increase test scores & lower anxiety
            * Controlling for Z may drop rxv to zero
            * e.g Ice cream sales & public pool drownings
    * So why not do _only_ experiments?
        * Pros: control confounds, **internal validity** (casual inference)
        * Cons: Feasibility, ethics, **ecological validity**
            - Relecance of findings in different enviromental contexts
    * Example of a Correlational Cognitive Study
        - Relationship between **confidence** and **acuracy** of eyewitness in identifying perpetrators
- **Confidence vs. Knowledge**
    * How well do you know what you know (or don't know)?
    * Does this level of confidence predict accuracy?
        - "I attended every lecture, read the chapters several times, and thought I did pretty well on the exam but..."
    * Familiarity/understanding vs. Knowing
        - Comprehension vs. Production
    * Students who do well are beter at:
        - KNowing what they know (and don't know)
        - Mastering what they don't know
    * How to get there:
        - **Distributed vs. massed practice**
        - **Test yourself along the way**
            * **Gnerating** vs **reviewing**
        - **Seek critical feedback**
- Psychobiological Studies
    * **Postmortem studies**
        - Examine the cortex of deceased people who experienced reading disability
    * **Brain-damed** individuals and their deficits
    * Monitor **brain physiology** participants doing a cognitive task
- Self Report Studies
    * **Verbal Protocol**
        - Participants describe their consious thorughts while solving a story problem
    * **Diary Study**
- Naturalistic Observation
    * Detailed study of congition in everyday (non-laboratory) situations
    * Useful for hypothesis formulation (vs. testing)
        - Monitor decision making of pilots during flights
- Case Studies
    * Intesive studies of individuals
        - May examine archival record, inteviews, direct observation, or participant-observation
            * **Craetivity of successful individuals**
            * **The deficits of a neglected child**
            * **The most famous cognitive case study?**
                - H.M (Henry Gustav Molaison)
                - Age 27: Bilateral lobectomy for severe seizures. Hippocampus damaged -- anterograde amnesia
                - Studied 55 Years! Died in 2008.
- Computers & Cognitive Research
    * Computers as analogy for _human_ cognition
        - The _sequence_ of _symbol manipulation_ that unerlies **thinking**
        - Goal : Discovery of the programs in *human* memory * other mental processes
    * Computer simulations of **Artificial Intelligence**
        - Recreate _human mental processes_ using computers
            * **Eg manipulate objects in 3D space; pattern recognition
- Recap: Some Underlying Themes
    * Nature vs. Nurture
        - Genes/Biology and enviroment influence cognition
    * Rationalist cs. EMpericism
        - Logical resasoning/theory and observation/experience/testing
    * Structure vs. Processes
        - Elements/content of mind and how they operate
    * Domain Generality vs. Domain Specificity
        - Processes relevant to multiple domains (e.g intellegence) vs. Fodor's "modularity" of mind (seperatre linguistic vs. perceptual processes)
    * Causal Inferences vs. Ecological Validity
        - E.g Internal Validity of experiemnts vs/. Ecological validity of case studies & naturalistic obs (see Table 1.1 Text)
    * Applied vs. Basic Research
        - **Basic**: Goal is discovery; to understand, satify curisity, expand our knowledge
            * Although.. Baisc reaearch often leads to important applications
                - But often there's no forseeable praticual use when conducted
        - **Applied**: Goal is pragmatic; to create, invent, solve a pratical problem
            * Often contirbutes to a more **basic** understandinf of cognition
                -  Priming is explained by spreading activation in memory (basic)
                    * Also expalins why skilled readers may read faster (application)
    * Biological vs. Behavioral Methodology
- Key Ideas in Cognitive...
    * Data can only be fully explained with theories, and theories are insufficient without data, thus creating the ctycle of 
    * Cognition is typically adaptive
        - But erroes humans regularly make can be informative
        - Example: Spoonerisms
            * A "lack of pies" ( A pack of lies)
            * Its "roaring with pain" (Its pouring with rain)
            * Systematic (non-random)
                - Hmm. what might this usggest about cognition of language and speech production?"
    * Cogntiive processes **interact** with each other and with non-cognitive processes
        - Emotions may affect decisions
        - You learn better when you're motivated to learn
        - Working memory capacity contributes to reading speed
        - Brain Biology affects Cognitiion
        - Cognition (e.g learning) affects brain biology
    * Cognition and Intelligence
        - Intelligence
            * An integrating ("umbrella") psychological construct
                - Ties together much research in cogntivie psychologi
            * Involoves:
                - The capacity to learn from experience, using metacognitive processes to enhance learning
                - The ability to adapt to the surrounding enviroment
            * Psychometric Approach to Intelligence
                - IQ Tests
                - Weschler: WASI, WISC, WAIS
                - Standord Binet
- Cognitive Models of Intelligence
    * Three Stratum Model of Inelligence
        - "Cattell-Horn-hCarroll Theory"
        - Hierarchy of Contiive Abilities within 3 Stata
            * Stratum I: Specigic Abilities (e.g Spelling ability)
            * Stratum II: Broad Abilities (e.g fluid and crystallized intelligence)
            * Stratum III: Generalized Intelligence ("g")
        - Fluid Intelligence = Speed & Accuracy of abstract reasoning, novel problem solving
        - Crystallized Intelligence = Accumulated knowledge & vocuabulary
        - Also: Quant reasoning, Reading/writing ability, storage/retriveal/ visual & auditory processing, processing speed, decision/ reacion time
    * Theory of Mutliple Itellgiences
        - Gardner
        - Claims 8 distinct, independent intelligences
        - Modular but can interact
            * Linguistic
            * Logical-mathematical
            * Spatial
            * Musical
            * Body-Kinesthic
            * Interpersonal
            * Intrapersonal
            * Naturalist
        - IQ Tests address only linguistic , logic, and spacial aspects
        - Evidence: exceptional individual, lesions destroy 1 type, core operatoins for each type (vs. factor analysis of psychometric tests)
        - Not well-established; untested, may be unfalsifiable
    * Triarchic Theory of Intelligence
        - Sternberg
        - INtelligence constsis of creative, analytical, and pratical abilities
