Chapter 4 - Attention
=====================
- **Attention**
    * Definition of **Attention**: 
        - Means by which we *actively process* **limited amount** of information 
            * From enormous amounts of info available through
                - Senses
                - Stored Memories 
                - Other Cognitive Processes
        - We have **Limited** mental (cognitive) resources
            * **Necessitating selectivity**
        - Attending helps with **memory** 
            * (salient info)
    * Functions of **Attention**:
        - **Vigilance**: Detecting
        - **Search**: Searching for
        - **Selective Attention**: Seleceting Stimuli for Further Processing
        - **Divided Attention**: Allocating our limited processing resources
- **Consciousness**
    * The feeling of **awareness and content of awareness**
        - (The info you're aware of manipulating)
    * Both **conscious** and **preconscious** attention
        - Can attend to (process some) info **w/o awareness**.
        - **Harder to study preconscious process** 
            * Since we lack awareness of them
    * **Conscious Attention**
        - **Monitor** interactions with enviroment
        - **Link** past (memories) and present (sensations) 
            * To give **continuity of experience** and **identity**
        - **Control** and **plan** our future actions
    * **Preconscious Attention**
        - Attending to items that **lie outside** our **conscious** awareness.
        - **Some can be made conscious, some not**...
        - Examples:
            * Stored Memories? 
            * Sensations? 
            * Reading? Driving? Subliminal Messages?
- **Priming**
    * Present a stimulus (**prime**) 
        - Prime *biases* how *subsequent* stimulus ("probe"/"target") is processed
    * Priming can be **conscious or preconscious**
        - **Conscious**: If *aware* of the prime
        - **Preconscious**: Outside awareness* (subliminal)
            * Priming by **subliminal** stimuli provides good evidence of *preconcious attention*
    * **Facilitative** versus **Negative** Priming
        - (Speeding or Slowing Process)
        - **Facilitative Priming**
            * Given stimulus **increases** likelihood 
                - **Subsequent related/identical stimulus will be processed**
                - (e.g retrived from long-term memory)
            * Target stimuli processed **faster** if preceeded by a **related** word
                - e.g *BUTTER* target primed by *BREAD* prime
                - e.g *PINE* target primed by *PALM* prime
        - **Negative Priming**
            * Stimulus **decreases** likelihood 
                - **Processeing next related stimulus**
            * Target stimuli processed **slower** if prceeded by a **un-related word**
                - e.g *HAND* targed primed by **PALM** (tree)
    * **Marcel** (1983) **Priming Experiment**
        - When **preconsious (sublimnial)** prime "PALM"
            * **Faster reaction time** for target words **PINE** and **WRIST**
            * So meaning of "PALM" (tree and body part) primed
        - When **conscious** (superliminal) prime "PALM"
            * Faster reaction time for one of targets (PINE/WRIST)
                - Slower for other
            * So **only one meaning is primed**
                - (One is negative primed/inhibited)
    * **Bowers, Regehr, Balthazard & Parker** - **Diads of Triads** (1990)
        - Diad of Triads presented..
        - Place a **fourth word** into one of the **two categories**
        - Not sure of why place word into fourth category
        - Result demonstrate **preconscious processing**
    * **Tip-of-the-Tongue** Experiences (**TOT**)
        - You know the word but can't bring into consciousness
        - Paradigms used to generate TOT states:
            * Show pictures of famous people or politations
                - Have participants give name
            * Ask general knowledge questions to generate TOTs
    * **Blindsight**
        - Person **cannot see** *portion* of **visual field**
        - Person **behaves** in some instances **as if they can see it**
        - Being **aware** of doing something is **distinguishable** from **doing something**
- **Automatic** versus **Controlled Processes**
    * **Automatic Processing**
        - Requires **no conscious control**
        - Outside consciousness
        - **Parallel processing** -- all at once
        - **No awareness** or **attention**
        - Unintentional
    * **Controlled Processing**
        - Requires **conscious control**
        - **Sequential**: One step at a time
        - Takes effort, attention, awareness
- **Automatization**
    * The process by which a **procedure changes** from 
        - Being highly **conscious** to being relativly **automatic**
    * **Integrated Components Theory** (Anderson, 1983)
        - Practice of indivudal steps leads to integration of procedure
        - Eventual steps consolidated into highly integrated process
        - Integrated Process requires little or not cognitive resources (attention)
            * e.g telgraph operators automatize sending/recivng messages)
                - first letters, then words, phrases, and larger groups of words
    * **Instance Theory** (Logan, 1988)
        - We gradually accumulate knowledge about specific responses to specific stimuli
            * Counting (general procedures) vs. knowing (specific instances)
        - Example:
            * Learn to count for handling number
            * But we learn to recognize certain combinations (know -- specific instances)
    * **Efects of Practice** on Automatization
        - Effects of practive exhibit **negatively accelerated curve**
        - Learn less because you have automizated more
        - Rate of learning **decereases** as amount of learning **increases**
- **Habituation and Dishabituation**
    * **Habituation**
        - **Less Attention** in reponse when exposed to repeated stimulus
        - Ex. People who smoke do not notice smell of cigerretes on clothes, but nonsmokers do
        - Ex. People get used to hearing the chming of their clocks
    * **Dishabituation**
        - **Change** in familiar stimuli cause one to notice it again
        - Ex. Smokers who quit, suddenly notice how much their clothes smell of smoke
        - Ex. If clock breaks, suddently owner notices clock isn't chiming
    * **Habituation/Dishabituation Paradigm**
        - Allows psychologists to nonverbally test stimulus detection abilities of infances & animals
        - Measure subject's arousal level to see if change occurs when pattern/sound is changed
            * If animal/infant dishabituates to change, they can detect the change
            * If animal/infant does not dishabituate to change in stimuli, they didn't detect change
- **Functions of Conscious Attention**
    * **Signal Detection**
        - Percieve **appearance** of signal (target stimulus) amid noise
        - Examples: 
            * Radar, Shower/phone ringing, cancer, ambulence siren
        - **Signal Detection Theory** (SDT)
            * Used to measure how much we percieve, attend, decide under conditions of uncertainty
            * Affected by / Contributing Factors include:
                - Experience/training, physiological state (fatigue)
                - Response bias
                - Expectations (how much anticipate signal)
                - Value of signal (costs/benefits)
                - Making right (detect/reject) vs wrong (miss/false alarm) decision
                - Change detection thresholds but tradeoffs:
                    * Sensitive airport screens, medical tests..
            * Classification of Signals
                * **Hit**: Signal Present, Decision Present
                * **Miss**: Signal Absent, Decision Present
                * **False Alarm**: Signal Absent, Decision Present
                * **Correct Rejection**: Signal Absent, Decision Absent
        - **Vigilence**: Attending to set of stimuli over length of time in order to detect target signal
            * Vigilence in SDT decreases rapidly over time (fatigue)
            * Thus, misses and false alarms increase 
    * **Visual Search**
        - Actively **search** enviroment to find targets among distractors.
        - Influencing Factors:
            * Number of targets & distractors influence accuracy
            * Feature search versus conjunctive Search
        - **Conjunctive vs. Feature Search**
            * **Conjunctive Search**: Look for particular combination (joining) of features
                - Ex.  Find T in a pane of L... only one distint feature differnce (harder)
            * **Feature Search**: Scan enviroment for distinct feature
                - Look for O in a pane of L's... O is disntcly differnt  (easier)
        - **Trisman Feature-Integration Theory**
            * Explains relative ease of feature search & diffucult of conjunctive search
            * **Feature Search**:
                - Individual feature processing done in parallel.
                - Simultaneous process done on the whole display
                - If feature present, we detect it.
            * **Conjunctive Seach**
                - Attention to integration or conjunction of features.
                - Attention to particular combination of features done sequentially to detect presence of certain combo.
        - **Similarity Theory**
            * Similarity between **target** and **distractor** is important
                - *Unlike FIT*, number of features to be combined is not important
                - More **Similar** features = more difficult to detect a target
                - Two arrays w/ same # of distractors
                    * Differ in distracter-target similariry
                    * Finding capital R is harder in a array of all captial letters
                    * Finding capital R is easier in array of lowercase letters
        - **Guided Search Theory** (Cave and Wolf, 1990)
            * **All searches** have **2 phases**:
                - **Parallel Stage**
                - **Serial Stage**
            * First do the parallel comparison, then do the serial comparison 
    * **Selective Attention**
        - **Focus** on aspect of a scene, ignoring other aspects
        - **Cocktail Party Problem**
            * How are we able to follow one conversation in the presence of other converstions?
        - **Cherry's Shadowing Technique**
            - Experiment:
                * Presnted in two ears:
                    - Attended Ear: The doctor went to the park to find the homless man. He was...
                    - Unattended Ear: The lawyer defended his client as the trial begain. He was able...
                * Listen to two conversations and **shadow** (repeat back) one.
                * Messages may be **binaural** or **dichotic**
                    - **Binaural** = both ears get same two messages
                    - **Dichotic** = ear ear gets differnt message
            - Results:
                * Noticed in unattended ear:
                    - Change in gender
                    - Change in tone
                * Did not notice in unattended ear
                    - Changed semnatics
                    - Changed language
                * Also found 1/3 pepole will switch attention when name presented
        - **Models of Selective Attention**
            * **Broadbent's Model** (1958)
                - Input -> Sensory Stores -> Sensory Filter -> Working Memory <-> Long Term Memory
                - Only one sensory chanlle is allowed to proceeed
                - Stimuli filtered at **sensory level**
                - **Shortcomings** of Broadbent's Model
                    * Participants name often get through (Neville Moray, 1959)
                        - Cocktail party effect
                    * Partipants can attend to shadowed channel based on meaning in message (Gray & Wedderburn, 1960)
                        - Left (shadowed) ear gets: "Dear 7 Jane..."
                        - Right (unattended) ear gets "9 aunt Jane..."
                        - Reported hearing: "Dear aunt Jane...."
                        - So, attention switches channels based on context/meaning (top-down!)
                    * Effects of BLANK on detecting information in unattended ear
                        - Detect digits in unattended ear: naive vs. practiced partipants
            * **Treisman's Attentuation Model**
                - "Leaky Filter" or BLANK (but still early) stage model
                - Input -> Sensory Stores -> Attentuator & Dictionary Unit -> Working Memory <-> Long Term Memory
                - **Dictionary Unit**: contains stored words & activation thersholds
                    * Uncommon, important words, (e.g your name) = lower threshold
                - **Attentuator**
                    * Analuzes physical characteristics, language, & meaning
                    * **Weakens the thrshold** of unattended information
            * **Late Selection Theory** (Deutsch & Deutsch 1963)
                - Input -> Sensory Stores -> Working Memory <-> Long Term Memory
                - All stimuli is processed to the level of BLANK
                - Relevance determines further processing and action
            * **Multimode Theory** (Jonston & Heinz 1978)
                - Attention is **flexible**
                - 3 Stages of Processing
                    * First, Construct **Sensory** representations (preconscious)
                    * Second, Construct **Semantic** representations (preconscious)
                    * Third, Construct combination representations from stages 1&2
                - In 1&2
                    * Can select one message over another at any stage
                        - Early (Broadbent) or later
                    * Conciosuness of mental taks (amount of concentration required) depends in part by when selection takes place:
                        - More effort for selection in (3) than earlier stages
            * **Neisser's Synthesis**
                - Two processes governing attentin: preattentive & attentive
                - **Preattentive Processes** (Automatic)
                    * Operate in parallel, automatic
                    * Note only physical characteristics, snsory qualities of unattended stimulus
                - **Attentive Processes** (Controlled)
                    * Controlled processes occur later
                    * Occurs in **working memory**
                    * Require time & mental resources (e.g working memory)
                    * Used to observe feature difference, syntehsize fragments into representation of whole object
            * **Attentional-Resource Theories**
                - In contrast to signal-blocking/attentuating models
                - Focuses on approtaing adequete attentional resouces
                - Fixed amount of attention we choose how to allocate to demanding taks
                - Single pool of resources or seperate pools?
                    * Kahneman (1973): Single pool resources divided among tasks
                    * Individual fors for each sense (visual, auditory)
                    * Can divide attention better if different modalities
            * **Stroop Effect**
                - Say the color of the word -- blue in red text ex.
                - Reading & color naming are visual tasks
                    * Same moadlity
                    * Compeition for limited pool of processing resources
    * **Divided Attention**
        - Attend to **more than one** stimulus at a time
        - **Dual Task Paradigm**
            * Procedure requiring individual to perform **two tasks** *simultaneously*
            * Compare dual task performance to performance on each taks alone
            * Ex:
                - Task 1 requires verbal response to auditory stimulus
                - Task 2 requires a button push (manual response) to visual stimulus
            * Performance on one task is often poor when done at same time as other task
                - Indicates **interference**
                - Suggests **one pool** for same processing resources
            * More Examples:
                - Driving & Cell Phones / Adjusting Music / Watching Scenery
                - Almost BLANK% of crashes and 65% of near-crashes involved some form of drive innattention within 3 seconds of the event
        - **Strayer & Drews** (2007)
            * Naturalistc observation of cell phone use and driver behavior
            * Impact of **hands free** cell phone conversation of simulated driving
                - Cell phone conversation lead to BLANK BLANK
                    * Even if they looked at object, partipant did not remeber the object
                    * Conscious perception **requires** BLANK
        - **Invisible Gorilla Tests** (Ulric Neisser, Neisser and Beklen, 1975)
            * Partipants watch short video
                - 2 groups of people in black & white tshirts pass basketball
            * Count number of passes on one team, or count of bounce passes, ariel, etc.
            * Woman walks through scene sarrying umbrella or wearing gorilla suit
            * Did you see anything unusual
        - **Complex Mental Processes**
            * Often unaware how we do more "simple" mental tasks, like perception (e.g recognize letters)
            * Do we have conscious access to at least our more complex mental processes?
                - Some say we do (Ericsson & Simon)
                - Some say we don't (Nisbett & Wilson)
            * Evidence on both sides says:
                - BLANK analysis: can describe how we solve problems vs.
                - Thought BLANK paradox
                    * More you try not to hink about something/someone, the more you do (white bears, your ex).
                    * Suggests minimal control, let alone access to thought process
        - **Change Blindness**
            * Inability to detect **change** in stimuli (viewed objects or scenes, auditory or tactile stimuli)
            * Supring occurs, given adaptive advantage of detecting dangers/opportunities in enviroment
            * Ability to miss the obvious can be remarkable
                - Only BLANK% notice when strager who they were already talking is replaced w/ other person (Simons & Levin 1997)
                - Difficulty detecting changes in picture scenes even when told to look for them
                    * Depends on object importance
                    * Visual change blindness depends on brief delay between original & changed scene
            * Cultural Differences
                - Americans recognize BLANK item changes feaster than peripheral
                - East Asians: recognize peripheral item changes faster than central
            * Right Parietal Cortex Plays Role:
                - Stimulation delays recognition of a change
        - **Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder** (ADHD)
            * Symptoms/Subtypes:
                - Inattentive: distractivable, miss detail, careless mistakes, forget/lose things, fail to complete tasks
                - Hyperactivity/Impulsivity
            * Not everyone w/ symptoms has ADHD
                - 3-12% of children (> 2 million in US); can persis into adulthood
                - Behavior must be demonstrated to degree inapproriate for person's age & impairs daily functioning
            * Causes Unkown
                - Genes x Enviroment Interaction:
                    * Hertaible factors, prental/postnatal toxin exposure (smoking, lead, alcohol, etc.)
                    * May not be a problem w/ attention per se but BLANK functions
                - Increasing prevelence
                    * More diagnosis & (over) treatment (DA stimulants, NE enhancers, therapy)
                    * Exposure to... (TV, video games, enviromental toxins)
        - **Spatial Neglect**
            * Lesion on onse side of brain causes person to **neglect** half of their visual field
            * Neglected field usually contraleral to damaged side (though can be whole field)
                - Don't notice lines continue on left so identified "middle" is biased to the right
            * Usually damage in one parietal lobe
            * Poetntially cause
                - Visual systems mutually inhibit one another
                - Dmaage to one prevents inhibition of other
        - Three Attention Networks (Posner)
            * 1. Alerting network
                - Sustaining attention (vigilance) to detect & respond to infrequent targets
                    * Alerting
                    * Being *prepared* to *atend* to some incoming event and maintining this attention

                - Yerkes-Dodson Law & Arousal
                    * Empirical Relationship between arousal & performance
                    * Increasing arousal leads to better performance, to a point
                    * Further arousal decreases performance in attention demanding tasks
            * 2. Orienting
                - The selection of stimuli attend to
                - Disengagement from prior stimulus
                - Shift to new stimulus (saccade, visual persuit)
                - Engagement
                - Used in visual search
                - Can also orient automatically

                - Precise changes oer brief intervals of time
                - Vs. PET: prcise location but not time
            * Use in measuring attentional processes:
                - E.g) When are/aren't attentiontal resouces required?
            * Automatic, prceonscious brain activity (ERP) responses to deviant auditory stimlui (Naatanen et al 1998)
                - No performance decrease in attended primary task
                - Shows we do some *automatic* *superficial analysis/selection* of stimuli
