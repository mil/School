Chapter 4 - Attention
=====================
- Three Attention Networks (Posner)
    * 1. Alerting network
        - Sustaining attention (vigilance) to detect & respond to infrequent targets
    * Alerting
        * Being *prepared* to *atend* to some incoming event and maintining this attention
        * Deficient in ADHD
        * Related terms
            * Vigilance, Alterntess, Sustained attention, arousal
        * Involves
            - Based on fMRI evidence
            - Right Frontal Lobe
            - PArietal Lobe
            - Locus Coeruleus (the blue spot)
                * In pons (Brainstem)
                * Makes norepienpherine)
                    - Sympathetic (stress repsonse)
        * Yerkes-Dodson Law & Arousal
            - Empirical Relationship between arousal & performance
            - Increasing arousal leads to better performance, to a point
            - Further arousal decreases performance in attention demanding tasks
    * Orienting
        - The selection of stimuli attend to
            * Disengagement from prior stimulus
            * Shift to new stimulus (saccade, visual persuit)
            * Engagement
        - Used in visual search
        - Can also orient automatically
            * Bottom up, stimlus direven
        - Involves
            * Superior Parietal Lobe
    * Executive Attention
        - Processes for *monitoring* and reoslving *conflicts* that arise among internal processes
            * Conflictin thoughts, feelings, responses)
            * e.g avoiding orienting to popups while web browsing
        - Important for self-regulation
            * Staying goal-directed, despite:
                - Distrations & Temptations
        - Invloves
            * Aterior Cingulate
                - Dopamine
            * Laternal Ventral & Prefrontal Cortex
            * Basal Ganglia
- ERP and Attention
    * Based on EEG technique
    * Change sin electrical activity in response to stimulus event
        - Precise changes oer brief intervals of time
        - Vs. PET: prcise location but not time
    * Use in measuring attentional processes:
        - E.g) When are/aren't attentiontal resouces required?
            * Automatic, prceonscious brain activity (ERP) responses to deviant auditory stimlui (Naatanen et al 1998)
                - No performance decrease in attended primary task
                - Shows we do some *automatic* *superficial analysis/selection* of stimuli
