Chapter 4 - Attention
=====================
- **Attention**
    * Definition of **Attention**: 
        - Means by which we *actively process* **limited amount** of information 
            * From enormous amounts of info  available through
                - Senses,
                - Our Stored Memories 
                - And Other Cognitive Processes
        - We have **BLANK** mental (cognitive) resources, necessitating selectivity
        - Attending helps with **memory** (salient info)
    * Functions of **Attention**:
        - **Vigilance**: Detecting
        - **Search**: Searching for
        - **Selective Attention**: Seleceting Stimuli for Further Processing ()
        - **Divided Attention**: Allocating our limited processing resources
- **Consciousness**
    * The feeling of awareness and content of awareness
        - (The info you're aware of manipulating)
    * Both **conscious** and **preconscious** attention
        - Can attend to (process some) info **w/o awareness**.
        - **Harder to study preconscious process** since we lack awareness of them
    * **Conscious Attention**
        - **Monitor** interactions with enviroment
        - **Link** past (memories) and present (sensations) to give continuity of experience, identity
        - **Control** and **plan** our future actions
    * **Preconscious Attention**
        - Attending to items that lie outside our **conscious** awareness.
        - Some can be made conscious, some not... examples:
            * Stored Memories? Sensations? Reading? Driving? Subliminal Messages?
- **Priming**
    * Present a stimulus (**prime**) 
        - Prime *biases* how *subsequent* stimulus ("probe"/"target") is processed
    * Priming can be **conscious or preconscious**
        - *Conscious*: If aware of the prime
        - *Preconscious*: Outside awareness (subliminal)
            * Priming by **subliminal** stimuli provides good evidence of preconcious attention
    * **Facilitative** versus **Negative** Priming: (Speeding or Slowing Process)
        - **Facilitative Priming**
            * Given stimulus **increases** likelihood that subsequent related/identical stimulus will be processed
               - (e.g retrived from long-term memory)
            * Target stimuli processed **faster** if preceeded by a **related** word
                - e.g *BUTTER* target primed by *BREAD* prime
                - e.g *PINE* target primed by *PALM* prime
        - **Negative Priming**
            * Stimulus **decreases** likelihood of processeing next related stimulus
            * Target stimuli processed **slower** if prceeded by a un-related word
                - e.g *HAND* targed primed by **PALM** (tree)
    * Marcel (1983) Priming Experiment
        - When preconsious (sublimnial) prime "PALM"
            * Faster reaction time for target words PINE and WRIST
            * So meaning of "PALM" (tree and body part) primed
        - When conscious (superliminal) prime "PALM"
            * Fater reaction time for one of targets (PINE/WRIST), slower for other
            * So only one meaning is primed, one is negative primed/inhibited
    * Bowers, Regehr, Balthazard & Parker (1990)
        - Diad of Triads presented..
        - Place a fourth word into one of the two categories
        - Not sure of why place word into fourth category
        - Result demonstrate prconscious processing
    * Tip-of-the-Tongue Experiences (TOT)
        - You know the word but can't bring into consciousness
        - Paradigms used to generate TOT states:
            * Show picture sof famous people or politations and have participants give name
            * Ask general knowledge questions to gnereate TOTs
    * Blindsight
        - Person cannot see portion of visual field
        - Person beahves in some instances as if they can see it
        - Being aware of doing something is distinguishable from doing something


- Three Attention Networks (Posner)
    * 1. Alerting network
        - Sustaining attention (vigilance) to detect & respond to infrequent targets
    * Alerting
        * Being *prepared* to *atend* to some incoming event and maintining this attention
        * Deficient in ADHD
        * Related terms
            * Vigilance, Alterntess, Sustained attention, arousal
        * Involves
            - Based on fMRI evidence
            - Right Frontal Lobe
            - PArietal Lobe
            - Locus Coeruleus (the blue spot)
                * In pons (Brainstem)
                * Makes norepienpherine)
                    - Sympathetic (stress repsonse)
        * Yerkes-Dodson Law & Arousal
            - Empirical Relationship between arousal & performance
            - Increasing arousal leads to better performance, to a point
            - Further arousal decreases performance in attention demanding tasks
    * Orienting
        - The selection of stimuli attend to
            * Disengagement from prior stimulus
            * Shift to new stimulus (saccade, visual persuit)
            * Engagement
        - Used in visual search
        - Can also orient automatically
            * Bottom up, stimlus direven
        - Involves
            * Superior Parietal Lobe
    * Executive Attention
        - Processes for *monitoring* and reoslving *conflicts* that arise among internal processes
            * Conflictin thoughts, feelings, responses)
            * e.g avoiding orienting to popups while web browsing
        - Important for self-regulation
            * Staying goal-directed, despite:
                - Distrations & Temptations
        - Invloves
            * Aterior Cingulate
                - Dopamine
            * Laternal Ventral & Prefrontal Cortex
            * Basal Ganglia
- ERP and Attention
    * Based on EEG technique
    * Change sin electrical activity in response to stimulus event
        - Precise changes oer brief intervals of time
        - Vs. PET: prcise location but not time
    * Use in measuring attentional processes:
        - E.g) When are/aren't attentiontal resouces required?
            * Automatic, prceonscious brain activity (ERP) responses to deviant auditory stimlui (Naatanen et al 1998)
                - No performance decrease in attended primary task
                - Shows we do some *automatic* *superficial analysis/selection* of stimuli
