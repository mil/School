Chapter 5 - Memory Models
=========================
- Basics of Memory
    * **Memory** is
        - Means we use to *create*, *maintain* and *retrieve* 
        - Info about the past to use in the present
- **Processes in Memory**
    * **Encoding**
        - Processes used to **store** *information* in memory
    * **Storage**
        - Processes used to **maintan** *information* in memoryu
    * **Retrieval**
        - Processes usecd to *get information back* **out of** memory
- **Methods** Used to **Study Memory**
    * **Recall** versus **Recognition**
        - **Recall**
            * Produce a fact word, or other item from memory
            * **Deeper information processing** than recognition
                - e.g. Relating concepts on essay 
                    * vs. memorizing facts for multiple choice items
            * Mainly taps **expressive knowledge**
        - **Recognition**
            * Select or otherwise **identify** an item
            * **Recognize item** being one that you **learned previously**
            * **Recognition memory is better usualy than recall**
    * **Types of Recall**
        - **Free Recall**
            * **Recall all** the **words** you can 
            * From list you **saw previously**
            * With **no cues** given:
                - Repeat items in any order 
                - Which you can recall them
        - **Cued Recall**
            * **Recall everything** that is **associated** with Civil War
            * Participants given cue to faciliatate recall
        - **Serial Recall**
            * **Recall names** of all previous presidents 
                - **In the order they were elected**
            * Need to recall **exact order** as well as item names
- **Recognition Tasks**
    * Participant **selects from a list** of items they have previously seen
    * Examples
        - Circle all the word you saw previously
        - Indicate which pircture you saw yesterday
        - Mulitple choice tests
        - True/False Tests
- **Explicit Memory**
    * Type of *LTM* that involves **conscious recollection**
        - You know you are trying to retrieve information from memory
        - e.g recall/recognize words, facts, pirctures from a prior set of items
    * **Declarative Memory**
        - Memory for facts that can be stated 
        - **What/Who/When** -  propositional
        - E.g. 
            * Date of birth
            * Name best friend
            * What does dog look like
            * Who sang thriller, etc.
    * **Semantic Memory**
        - **Theoretical knowledge** 
        - Independnt of Personal Experience/Context
        - E.g 
            * Recognize others
            * Historical events/people
            * Info learned in school
            * General facts
    * **Episodic Memory**
        - Factual knowledge of **personal experience**
            * (autobiographical)
        - In **specific time & place** (your life experiences)
        - Remeber that trip to Paris 
            * Sights, Smells, etc.. you experienced
- **Implicit Memory** *(Non-Declarative)*
    * Requires **retrieval of information** from memory 
        - **Without conscious awareness**
    * *Task completion* can **indirectly** indicate *implicit memory*
        * E.g word completion task
    * **Procedural Memory**
        - Memory for process (how to - action)
            * e.g: how to tie shoes, play an instrument, etc...
        - Procedure becomes implicit with learning/practice
        - Procedure is not easily 
            * Verbalized
            * Articulated/Explained (declared)
        - Involves **cerebellum**
        - Examples Promcedural Memory Tasks
            * **Rotary-Pursuit Task**
                - Keep stylus on a dot on a rotating disk
            * **Mirror-Tracing Task**
                - Watch mirror image to trace a figure
                - How do these test procedural memory?
    * **Priming**: 
        - Response to target stimulus influenced by previous presentation of prime stimulus
    * **Classical** (*Pavlovian*) Conditioning: 
        - Associate neutral antecedent event/condition (CS)
        - With reflex-evoking stimulus (UCS). 
        - eg. Little Albert's fears
    * **Operant** (*Skinnerian*)
        - Associate reward or punishment consequence 
        - With a voluntary behavior
    * **BLANK**
        - **Desensitization**: 
            * Decrease attention response to 
                - Repeated benign stimulu
        - **Sensitization**
            * Increase attention response to 
                - Intense / noxious stimulus
- **Process-Dissociation** Model (Jacoby 1991)
    * Implicit vs. Explicit Memory may *both* have role in every response
        - But could they be **seperable process** in the brain?
    * **Process Dissociation Procedure**: 
        - Measures **Controlled** & **Automatic** memory processes
        - See how much each contributes
    * **Single Dissociation** Method: 
        - Show **single variable** affects 
            * Expression of **one cognitive process** 
            * But does not effect other
            * (e.g explicit but not implicit memory)
        - Show that **manipulating A** affects **performance**
            * On task X 
            * But not task Y
        - Examples
            * Brain lesioning
                - Lesion to one region affects only one process
                - While leasions to another region affects both
                - So the regions are not completly functionally indepenedent 
            * Amensia
                - Amnesiac patient still shows **priming effects** (**implicit**) 
                - Even when they **fail at recall** (**explicit**)
            * H.M (medial temporal lobe damage) 
                - Had *intact* **working** and **procedural** memory
                - But *impaired* **declarative** memory
            * **Aging affects **
                - **Explicit** (declarative) memory but
                - **Not Implicit** Memory
                - (e.g learning rotary persuit task)
            * Shift from auditory to visual presentation during encoding 
                - **Affects implicit** 
                - But **not explicit memory**
    * **Double Dissociation** Method:
        - Show **two variables** have *different* effects 
            * On **two cognitive processes**
            * Ex. *explicit & implicit* memory
        - **Show that**
            *  **Maniuplating A** affects **performance**
                - On task X 
                - Not on task Y
            2. **Manipulating B** affects **performance **
                - On task Y 
                - Not on task X
        - Examples...
            * Broca's Patients 
                - Couldn't speak but **could understand**
                - Whereas Wernike's patients **couldn't understand** 
                    * But could produce speech
            * Visual *identification* 
                - "Knowing *what*" pathway
                    * From visual cortex to *temporal lobe 
                - vs. "Knowing *where* pathway (location)
                    * From visual cortex to *parietal* lobe
            * **Hippocampus Damage** (Jacoby 1991)
                - Lessions to **two seperate regions**
                - Differentially Affect two processes. 
                - So they are at least in part **functionally independent**
                - Impairs *recollection* 
                    * Remembering, Detailed Retrieveal
                - Does not Impair *Familiarity* 
                    * Knowing; 
                    * Feeling Event was experience 
                        - Without Recollection
                    * Whereas medial temporal lobe damage 
                        - Impairs familiarity but not recollection
            * Older Adults 
                - Older show greater *implicit* memory 
                    * For irrelevant information 
                - Younger show greater *explicit* memory 
                    * For irrelevant information 
- **Models of Memory**
    * Represent **ways memory** can be **conceptualized**
    * **Atkinson & Shiffrin (1968) 3-Stage Model** 
        - **(Traditional Model)**
        - Stimuli -> Sensory Stores -> Short-Term Store <-> Long-Term Store
        - **Sensory Store**: 
            * Stores *Large Amounts* of **info**
            * For *Very Brief* periods 
                - Before transfer to STM or loss
            * **Iconic Store**: 
                - **Visual sensory register**
                - Holds info for very *short period* (<1sec)
                    * In form of icons that look like 
                    * The Distal Object
                - E.g 
                    * Tray name w/ sparkler
                    * Memory trace persists
                    * But not physical trace
            * **Visual Sensory Store**
                - Holds visual information for 250 msec longer
                - Information held i pre-categorical
                - Capacity - up to 12 items
                - Information fades quickly
            * **Ecohic Store** 
                - Auditory Sensory Register
                - Holds auditory information for 2-3 seconds 
        - **Short-Term Store**: 
            * Stores **Limited Amount* info 
            * For **Somewhat Longer Periods**
                - Usually about 30 seconds
                - Unless rehearsed
            * Information fades quickly
            * Our **window on the present**
                - Holds everything you think about at any given moment
            * **Atention**
                - Attending to sensory store info 
                - *Encodes* (transfers) it to *STM*
            * **Rehearsal**
                - Repeating info keeps it stored (*maintained*) in STM
                    * Or **lose it** (usually within about 30 seconds)
            * **Retrieval**
                - Access memoryu in LTM and **BLANK** STM
        - **Long-Term Memory (Store)**: 
            * Very *large capacity*
            * Stores *lots of info* for *very long times*
                - **Perhaps indefinetly**
            * System that stores information for 
                - Very long periods of time ("archive")
            * **Capacity**
                - Thus far, **appears limitless**
                - No clear way to test limits
                    * Can't 'max out' like STM
            * **Duration**: 
                - Permanenet
                - *Wilder Penfield*
                    * Electrically stimluated epilptic patients 
                    * Cerebral cortices
            * **Permastore**:
                - *Very long term* storage of some info 
                - Foreign Language, Math
- **Research into Memory Stores**
    * **Sperling (1960) Iconic Memory Research**
        - **Whole Report** Procedure
            * **Flash a matrix of letters** for **50 milliseconds**
            * Report as many letters as possible
            * Participants typically **remebered 4 letters**
        - **Partial Report** Procedure
            * **Flash a matrix of letters** for **50 millisceonds**
            * Report bottom row only (or any row requested)
            * Show iconic memory is:
                - **Larger than whole report first suggested**
    * **Averbach & Coriell (1961) Iconic Memory Research**
        - **Showed Matrix** for **50 mesc**
        - Place a **small mark above a letter** 
            * At different delays
        - Results indicated 
            * As many as **12 letters** could be stored in sensory memory
        - **Backward Visual Masking**
            * Stimulus presented in same position after target letter
            * Can erase the visual icon in memory
    * **Miller (1956) STM Research**
        - Your STM can hold 4 +- 2 bits of information
            * Or chunks of information
        - STM info generally stored acoustically
    * **Luck & Vogel (2001) STM Research**
        - Storage Capacity of **Visual Short-Term Memory**
        - Used non-verbal objects with 
            * Different color and orientation features
        - **Change Detection Task**
            * Did the arry of objects change from sample to test array?
        - Taps only visual STM, vs. Letter Stimlui: 
            * *Verbal* or *Visual* STM
            * 3-4 Objects
        - Didn't mattrer if one or both features changed
            * Color and oerientation
        - So capacity of visual STM 
            * **Depends on # of objects**
            * *Not number of features*
        - Objects are the capacity indactor 
            * Not number of features
        - Features stored in VSTM 
            * In parallel or automitic pattern
    * **Bahrick's Research** on **Very Long Term Memory**
        - High school year books containing 
            * All of the names 
            * And photos of students used to acceses memory
        - 392 ex-high school students (17-74) 
            * Took 4 different memory tests
        - Free recall of the names
            * Photo Recognition Test
                - Asked to identify formet classmates
            * Name Recognition Test
                - A name and photo matching test
        - For some of the participants was long as **49** years 
            * since they graduated from High school
        - Results:
            * BLANK% accuracy in face and name recogition after 34 years
            * 60% accuracy for free recall after 15 years
            * 30% accuracy for free recall after 30 years

- **Levels of Processing** Models of Memory (LOP)
    * **Limitations of "Short Term Memory' Model**
        - Traditional 3-stage Model View: 
            * STM as short-term **storage** mechanism
        - But way we use memory in the moment includes both 
            * **Storage** and **Active Processes**
                - Transferring info between STM and LTM:
                - e.g: memorizing a phone number
            * Transfer info from STM to LTM during encoding, 
                - Back to STM during retrieval
        - **Comprehending a conversation**
            * "I'd like to order a large pizza with ham and pineapple."
            * "Sorry, were out of pineapple. Would you like mushrooms instead?"
            * Q: What would you be substituted with mushrooms? 
                - Must store 1st sentence while processing 2nd to be able to answer
        * **Doing Computations**:
            - Demo: multiply 43 times 6 in your head
            - So requires **storage** (hold) and **active** processes (carry, multiply)
        * So STM storage doesn't explain how we both 
            * Hold and work with currently active information
    - **Craik & Lockhart** propose **Levels of Porcessing** Memory Model (1972)
        * **Not focused on X # of stores**
        * Focused on **encoding as a continum**
            - Maybe an infinite # of **levels of processing** (LOP) 
                * To encode an item
            - **Focus on Process**
                * *Opposed to structure of memory*
        * **Deeper Processing** 
            - Leads to **better storage and retrieval**
            - Elaborating according to **meaning**
                * Leads to **strong memory **
                * Durable
                * Retrievable memory trace
        * **Shallow Processing**
            - Emphasizes *physical* features of stimulus 
            - Creates *fragile* memory
            - Quickly *decaying memory trace*
        * **Mainteance Rehearsal**: 
            - Continuosuly **Repeating Item **
            - Refered to as **Rote** Rehearsal
            - Maintains info in **STM only**
                * No Long-Term Retention
            - Examples:
                * Repeating a phone # to hold it in STM 
                * Until you dial (and forget) it
            - Works for **Simple Info**
        - **Elaborative Rehearsal**: 
            * Create a **Semantic Meaning**
            * Associate **New Material**
                - With **Material already in Long-Term Memory**
            * Examples:
                - Studying complex course material for an exam 
                    * Focusing on comprehending its meaning in a deeper context
                - Comparing and contrasting
                - Organizing, Imagery, etc..
    * LOP Support: **Craik & Watikins (1973)**
        - **Primacy Effect**: Better recall for early items in list
            * Suggests encoding and recall from LTM 
                * depends on *rehearsal* of infos
            - Also a **Recency Effect** for info recently put in STM
        - Does **type** of rehearsal affect 
            * Transfer from STM to LTM?
        - Design:
            * Instructed: At the end of each list, report last word beginning with a particular letter (e.g "G")
            * Particpants listened to 27 lists of words but **not** told to memorize them
            * After all lists were presented
                - Instructed to recall as many words as possible
                    * From all lists
            * IV: Varied the number of interviewing words (and time) between the words 
                - (Beginning with the target letter)
        - Results:
            * Found **no difference** in recall for words with zero vs. 12 intervening words
            * So, **recall of words** was 
                - **Independnt of** the length of **time** it was **maintained in STM**
            * **Participants rehearsed** without elaborating on the meaning of the words
                - Only focused on the initial consonant sound
            - Rehreasing at a *shallow maintence* level (vs. elaborative)
        * **Maintence Rehearsal** does not automatically lead to LTM storage
    * LOP Support: **Craik & Tulving** (1975)
        - Participants studied a list in **3 different ways**
        - **Structural**
            * Is the word in **capital letters**? 
            * Focus on letter case = structure
        - **Phonemic**
            * Does the word *ryhme* with dog?
            * Focus on **acuostic properties**
        - **Semantic**
            * Does the word *fit in* this sentence? 
            * The ____ is delicious.
        - Recognition test given to see which type of memory lead to the best memory.
            * From Best to Worst:
                - Semantic, Phonemic, Structural
    * **Criticisms of LOP Model**
        - How does it work? (unspecified mechanisms)
        - How do we measure "deeper" objectivly?
            * Circular definition: "deeper" level <-> better remembered
            * Deeper processing takes more effort - so does *effort level* explain it?
        - Doesn't explain: "**Transfer appropriate processing**"
            * Morris, Bransford, and Franks (1977)
            * Two processing tasks: semantic vs. rhyme
            * Two types of tests: standard yes/no recongition vs. rhyme test
            * Memory performance also dpends on the **match between type of encoding process and type of retrieval test**
- Baddeleys' **Working Memory** Model
    * Working Memory:
        - Holds the fleeting STM (lost in 30 secs w/o rehereasal to LTM) and 
        - Holds most recently activated (concious) content of LTM
        - Allows us to temporarily **store* ifnromation and **activly process** it
    * 3 "Slave" Systems
        * **Articulatory Loop** (aka Phonological Loop)
            - Converts visual language to an auditory code 
                * Through silent articulation 
            - Maintains acoustic (sound & speech) information for a short time
            - **Subvocal Rehearsal**: 
                * "Inner Speech" revives trace 
                    - Keeps info in WM

            - Reading rate seemed to determine recall performance 
            - Supports conceptulatization of **articulary loop**
        - Support for **Visuo Spatial Sketch Pad**

- **Multiple-Memory Models/Systems for Long-Term Memory**
    * Tulving's **Multiple-Memory Systems** Model (1972)
        - Suggests multiple systems involved in info **storage and retrieval**
        - Suggests 3 types of Long-Term Memory:
            * **Semantic Memory**
                - General knowledge
                - Facts, definitions, concepts, 
                - Ideas, historical dates
            * **Episodic Memory**

            - **Semantic**: "Rember your best friend's name..."
        * Results
            - Some evidence of **double dissociation**
            - Left prefrontal hemisphere 
                * More activate in **semantic memory retrieval**
