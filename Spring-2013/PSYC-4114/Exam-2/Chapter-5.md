Chapter 5 - Memory Models
=========================
- Basics of Memory
    * Memory is
        - Means we use to *create*, *maintain* and *retrieve* 
        - Info about the past to use in the present
- Processes in Memory
    * **Encoding**
        - Processes used to **store** *information* in memory
    * **Storage**
        - Processes used to **maintan** *information* in memoryu
    * **Retrieval**
        - Processes usecd to *get information back* **out of** memory
- **Methods** Used to **Study Memory**
    * **Recall** versus **Recognition**
        - **Recall**
            * To produce a fact word, or other item from memory
            * Elicits deeper information processing than recognition
                - e.g. relating concepts on essay vs. memorizing facts for multiple choice items
            * Mainly taps expressive knowledge
        - **Recognition**
            * Select or otherwise identify an item
            * Recognize item being one that you learned previously
            * Recognition memory is better usualy than recall
    * **Types of Recall**
        - **Free Recall**
            * Recall all the words you can from the list you saw previously
            * With no cues given, repeat items in any order inw hich you can recall them
        - **Cued Recall**
            * Recall everything that is associated with the Civil War
            * Participants are given a cue to faciliatate recall
        - **Serial Recall**
            * Recall the names of all previous presidents in the order they were elected
            * Need to recall exact order as well as item names
- **Recognition Tasks**
    * Participant selects from a list of items they have previously seen
    * Examples
        - Circle all the word you saw previously
        - Indicate which pircture you saw yesterday
        - Mulitple choice tests
        - True/False Tests
- **Explicit Memory**
    * A type of LTM that involves **conscious recollection**
        - You know you are trying to retrieve information from memory
        - e.g recall/recognize words, facts, pircture sfrom a prior set of items
    * **Declarative Memory**
        - Memory for facts that can be stated 
        - What/Who/When -  propositional
            * E.g. Date of birth, name best friend, what does dog look like, who sang thriller, etc.
    * **Semantic Memory**
        - Theoretical knowledge idnependent of personal experience/context
        - Recognize otheres, historical events/people, info learned in school, general facts
    * **Episodic Memory**
        - Factual knowledgee of a personal (autobiographical) experience 
        - In specific time & place (your life experiences)
        - Remeber that trip to Paris 
            * Sights, Smells, etc.. you experienced
- **Implicit Memory** (Non-Declarative)
    * Requires **retrieval of information** from memory 
        - **Without conscious awareness**
    * Task completion can indirectly indicate implicit memory
        * E.g word completion task
    * **Procedural Memory** (a type of Implicit Memory)
        - Memory for process (how to - action)
            * e.g: how to tie shoes, play an instrument, etc...
        - Procedure becomes implicit with learning/practice
        - Procedure is not easily verbalized/articulated/explained (declared)
            - Involves cerebellum
        - Examples Promcedural Memory Tasks
            * Rotary-Pursuit Task
                - Keep stylus on a dot on a rotating disk
            * Mirror-Tracing Task
                - Watch mirror image to trace a figure
                - How do these test procedural memory?
    * **BLANK**: 
        - Response to target stimulus influenced by 
        pervious presentation of prime stimulus
    * **BALNK** (Pvalovian) conditioning: learned to associate a neutral antecedent event/condition (CS) with a reflex-evoking stimulus (UCS). eg. Little Albert's fears
    * **BLANK** (Skinnerian): learn to associate reward or punishment consequence with a voluntary behavior
    * **BLANK**
        - **BLANK**: decrease in attention response to a rpeeated benign stimulu
        - **Sensitization**: increase in attention response to an intesne / noxious stimulus
- **Process-Dissociation** Model (Jacoby 1991)
    * Implicit vs. Explicit Memory may *both* have a role in almost every response
        - But could they be *seperable process* in the brain?
    * **Process Dissociation Procedure**: 
        - Measures **Controlled** & **Automatic** memory processes
        - See how much each contributes
    * **Single Dissociation** Method: 
        - Show **single variable** affects expression of **one cognitive process** but not other
            * (e.g explit but not implicit memory)
        - Show that **manipulating A** affects **performance**
            * On task X but not task Y (single dissociation)
            * Ex. 
                - Lesion to one region affects only one process
                - While leasions to another region affects both
                - So the regions are not completly functionally indepenedent 
        - Amensica patient still shows **priming effects** (**implicit**) even when they **fail at recall** (**explicit**)
            * H.M (medial temporal lobe damage) 
                - Had *intact working* and *procedural memory*
                - But *impaired declarative* memory
        - **Aging affects **
            * **Explicit** (declarative) memory but 
            * **Not Implicit** Memory
                - (e.g learning rotary persuit task)
        - Shift from auditory to visual presentation during encoding 
            * **Affects implicit** 
            * But **not explicit memory**
    * **Double Dissociation** Method:
        - Show *two* variable have *opposite* effects 
            * On **two cognitive processes**
            * Ex. explicit & implicit memory
        - **Show that**
            *  **Maniuplating A** affects **performance**
                - On task X 
                - Not on task Y
            2. **Manipulating B** affects performance 
                - On task Y 
                - Not on task X
        - Examples...
            * Broca's Patients 
                - Couldn't speak but could understand
                - Whereas Wernike's patients couldn't understand 
                    * But could produce speech
            * Visual *identification* 
                - "knowing *what*" pathway
                    * From visual cortex to *temporal lobe 
                - vs. 
                - "knowing *where* pathway (location)
                    * From visual cortex to *parietal* lobe
            * **Hippocampus Damage**
                - Lessions to **two seperate regions**
                - Differentially Affect two processes. 
                - So they are at least in part **functionally independent**
                - Impairs *recollection* 
                    * Remembering, Detailed Retrieveal
                - Does not Impair *Familiarity* 
                    * Knowing; 
                    * Feeling Event was experience 
                        - Without Recollection
                    * Whereas medial temporal lobe damage 
                        - Impairs familiarity but not recollection
    * Older Adults 
        - Older show greater *implicit* memory 
            * For irrelevant information 
        - Younger show greater *explicit* memory 
            * For irrelevant information 
- **Models of Memory**
    * Represent ways memory can be conceptualized
    * **Atkinson & Shiffrin (1968) 3-Stage Model** (Traditional Model)
        - Stimuli -> Sensory Stores -> Short-Term Store <-> Long-Term Store
        - **Sensory Store**: 
            * Stores *Large Amounts* of **info**
            * For *Very Brief* periods 
                - (Before transfer to STM or loss)
            * Contains **Iconic Store**: 
                - Visual sensory register, 
                - Holds info for very short period (<1sec)
                    * In form of icons that look like 
                        - The distal object
                - E.g 
                    * Tray name w/ sparkler
                    * Memory trace persists
                    * But not physical trace
    * **Sperling (1960) Iconic Memory Research**
        - **Whole report** procedure
            * Flash a matrix of letters for 50 milliseconds
            * Identify as many letters as possible
            * Participants typically remebered 4 letters
        - **Partial Report** Procedure
            * Flash a matrix of letters for 50 millisceonds
            * Partipants are told to report bottom row only
                - Or any row requested
            * Show iconic memory is:
                - **Larger than whole report first suggested**
    * **Averbach & Coriell (1961) Iconic Memory Research**
        - Showed matrix for 50 mesc
        - Place a small mark above a letter at different delays
        - Results indicated that as many as 12 letters could be stored 
            * In sensory memory
                - Backward visual masking
            * **Sesnsory Stores**   
                    - Iconic store or Visual Sensory Register
                    - Holds visual information for 250 msec longer
                    - Information held i pre-categorical
                    - Capacity - up to 12 items
                    - Information fades quickly
                * **Ecohic Stores (echo** or Audotiry Snsory Register
                    - Holds autidotryA
                * **Echoic Store** for auditory info (2-4 seconds)
    * **Short-Term Store**: 
        - Stores *limited amount* info 
        - For *Somewhat Longer Periods* 
            * Usually about 30 seconds
            * Unless rehearsed
        - Information fades quickly
        - Our *window on the present*
            * Holds everything you think about at any given moment
        - **Atention**
            * Attending to sensory store info 
            * *Encodes* (transfers) it to *STM*
        - **Rehearsal**
            * Repeating info keeps it stored (*maintained*) in STM
                - Or **lose it** (usually within about 30 seconds)
        - **Retrieval**
            * Access memoryu in LTM and BLANK STM

        - **Research on Short-Term Memory** 
            * Miller (1956)
                - Your mind can hold 4 +- 2 bits of information
                - Or chunks of information
            * Storage Capacity of Visual Short-Term Memory
                - Luck & Vogel (2001)
                - Used non-verbal objects with different color and orientation features
                - Taps only visual STM, vs. Letter Stimlui: 
                    * *Verbal* or *Visual* STM
                    * 3-4 Objects
                - So capacity of visual STM 
                    * **Depends on # of objects**
                    * Not number of features
                - Objects are the capacity indactor not number of features
                    * Features stored in VSTM in parallel or automitic pattern
            * **Change Detection Task**
                - Did the arry of objects change from sample to test array?
    * **Long-Term Memory (Store)**: 
        - Very *large capacity*
        - Stores *lots of info* for *very long times*
            * Perhaps indefinetly
        - System that stores information for 
        - Very long periods of time ("archive")
        - **Capacity**
            * Thus far, **appears limitless**
            * No clear way to test limits
                - Can't 'max out' like STM
        - **Duration**: 
            * permanenet
            * *Wilder Penfield*
                - Electrically stimluated epilptic patients 
                    * Cerebral cortices
            * **Permastore**:
                - *Very long term* storage of some info 
                - Foreign Language, Math
        - **Limitations of "Short Term Memory' Model**
            * Traditional 3-stage Model View: 
                - STM as short-term **storage** mechanism
            * But the way we use memory in the moment includes both 
                - **Storage** and **Active Processes**
                    * Transferring info between STM and LTM:
                    * e.g: memorizing a phone number
                - Transfer info from STM to LTM during encoding, 
                    * back to STM during retrieval
            * **Comprehending a conversation**
                - "I'd like to order a large pizza with ham and pineapple."
                - "Sorry, were out of pineapple. Would you like mushrooms instead?"
                - Q: What would you be substituted with mushrooms? 
                    * Must sore 1st sentence while processing 2nd to be able to answer
            * **Doing Computations**:
                - Demo: multiply 43 times 6 in your head
                - So requires **storage** (hold) and **active** processes (carry, multiply)
            * So STM storage doesn't explain how we both hold and work with currently active information

- **Levels of Processing** Models of Memory (LOP)
    * **Bahrick's Research** on **Very Long Term Memory**
        - High school year books containing all of the names and photos of students used to acceses memory
        - 392 ex-high school students (17-74) took 4 different memory tests
            * Free recall of the names
            * A photo recognition test where they were asked to identify formet classmates
            * A name recognition test
            * A name and photo matching test
        - For some of the participants it was as long as **49** years since they graduated from High school
    - **Craik & Lockhart** (1972)
        * Not focused on X # of stores, 
        * Focused on encoding as a **continum**
            - Maybe an infinite # of levels of processing (LOP) 
                * To encode an item
            - Focus on process 
                * Opposed to structure of memory
        * **Deeper Processing** 
            - Leads to better storage and retrieval
            - Elaborating according to meaning leads to strong memory 
                * Durable
                * Retrievable memory trace
        * **Shallow Processing**
            - Emphasizes *physical* features of stimulus 
            - Creates fragile
            - Quickly decaying memory trace
        * **Mainteance Rehearsal**: 
            - Continuosuly Repeating Item 
            - Refered to as **Rote** Rehearsal
            - Maintains info in STM only
                * No long-term retention
            - Examples:
                * Repeating a phone # to hold it in STM 
                    - Until you dial (and forget) it
            - Works for Simple Info
        - **Elaborative Rehearsal**: 
            * Create a semantic (meaning) 
            * Associate new material with material already in Long-Term Memory
            * Examples:
                - Studying complex course material for an exam 
                    * Focusing on comprehending its meaning in a deeper context
                - Comparing and contrasting
                - Organizing, Imagery, etc..
    * Craik & Watikins (1973) : **Primacy Effect**
        - Better recall for early items in list
        - Suggests that encoding and recall from LTM dpeneds on *rehearsal* of infos
            - Also a **Recency Effect** for info recently put in STM
        - Does **type ** of rehearsal affect transfer from STM to LTM?
        - Design
            * Instructed: At the end of each list, report the last word beginning with a particular letter (e.g "G")
            * Particpants listened to 27 lists of words but **not** told to memorize them
            * After all lists were presented, instructed to recall as many words as possible from all lists
            * IV: Varied the number of interviewing words (and time) between the words beginning with the target letter
        - Results
            * Found no difference in recall for words with zero vs. 12 intervening words
            * So, recall of words was 
                - *Independnt of the length of time it was matintined in STM*
            * Participants rehearsed without elabtorting on the meaning of the words
                - Only focused on the initial consonant sound
            - Rehearitng at a *shallow maintence* level (vs. elaborative)
        * **Maintence Rehearsal** does not automatically lead to LTM storage
    * **Craik & Tulving** (1975)
        - Participants studied a list in 3 different ways
        - **Structural**
            * Is the word in **capital letters**? 
            * Focus on letter case = structure
        - **Phonemic**
            * Does the word *ryhme* with dog?
            * Focus on acuostic properties
        - **Semantic**
            * Does the word *fit in* this sentence? 
            * The ____ is delicious.
        - Recognition test given to see which type of memory lead to the best memory.
            * From Best to Worst:
                - Semantic, Phonemic, Structural
    * **Criticisms of LOP Model**
        - How does it work? (unspecified mechanisms)
        - How do we measure "deeper" objectivly?
            * Circular definition: "deeper" level <-> better remembered
            * Deeper processing takes more effort - so does *effort level* explain it?
        - Doesn't explain: "**Transfer appropriate processing**"
            * Morris, Bransford, and Franks (1977)
            * Two processing tasks: semantic vs. rhyme
            * Two types of tests: standard yes/no recongition vs. rhyme test
            * Memory performance also dpends on the **match between type of encoding process and type of retrieval test**
- Baddeleys' **Working Memory** Model
    * Working Memory:
        - Holds the fleeting STM (lost in 30 secs w/o rehereasal to LTM) and 
        - Holds most recently activated (concious) content of LTM
        - Allows us to temporarily **store* ifnromation and **activly process** it
    * 3 "Slave" Systems
        * **Articulatory Loop** (aka Phonological Loop)
            - Converts visual language to an auditory code 
                * Through silent articulation 
            - Maintains acoustic (sound & speech) information for a short time
            - **Subvocal Rehearsal**: 
                * "Inner Speech" revives trace 
                    - Keeps info in WM
            - "**Articualtory Supression**"
                * **Inhibition of Subvocal Rehearsal**
                    - E.g Repeat a number while trying to lear a list of words
            - **Phonological Storage**: 
                * "Inner ear" briefly holds auditory memory trace
        * **Visuo-Spatial Sketch Pad**
            - Used for maintiang and processing visual & spatial information
            - Brief memory for 
                * Shapes, colors, location & speed of objects, 
                * Planning movement
        * **Episodic Buffer**
            - Used for storage of a multimodal code, 
            - Holding an integrated episode bwetween systems using different codes
            - Binds/integrates ST and LTM visual, spatial, phonological info to create unitary episodic represenation 
    * **Central Executive**

- **Multiple-Memory Models/Systems for Long-Term Memory**
    * Tulving's **Multiple-Memory Systems** Model (1972)
        - Suggests multiple systems involved in info **storage and retrieval**
        - Suggests 3 types of Long-Term Memory:
            * **Semantic Memory**
                - General knowledge
                - Facts, definitions, concepts, 
                - Ideas, historical dates
            * **Episodic Memory**
                - Autobiographical event memories
                - Your First Kiss, Your 6th Birthday
            * **Procedural Memory**

            - **Episodic**: "Remeber the time you last saw your best friend"
            - **Semantic**: "Rember your best friend's name..."
        * Results
            - Some evidence of **double dissociation**
            - Left prefrontal hemisphere 
                * More activate in **semantic memory retrieval**
