Chapter 5 - Memory Models
=========================
- Memory is
    * The means we use to *create*, *maintain* and *retrieve* information about he past to use in the present
- Processes in Memory
    * **Encoding**
        - Processes used to **store** *information* in memory
    * **Storage**
        - Processes used to **maintan** *information* in memoryu
    * **Retrieval**
        - Processes usecd to *get information back* **out of** memory
- Methods Used to Study Memory
    * Which type of memory test would you rather have?
        - An essay or a *multiple choice exam*
    * The different between these two types of tests captures the difference between a *recall* task and a *recognition* test
        - Recall = to produce a fact word, or other item from memory
            * Usually elicits deeper information processing than recognition
                - e.g. relating concepts on essay vs. memorizing facts for multiple choice items
            * Mainly taps expressive knowledge
        - Recognition = to slect or otherwise identify an item and being one that you learned previously
            * Recognition memory is better usualy than recall
    * Free Recall
        - Recall all the words you can from the list you saw previously
        - With no cues given, repeat items in any order inw hich you can recall them
    * Cued Recall
        - Recall everything you can that is associated with the Civil War
        - Participants are given a cue to faciliatate recall
    * Serial Recall
        - Recall the names of all previous presidents in the order they were elected
        - Need to recall exact order as well as item names
- Recognition Tasks
    * The participant selects from a list of items they have previously seen
        - Examples
            * Circle all the word you saw previously
            * Indicate which pircture you saw yesterday
            * Mulitple choice tests
            * True/False Tests
- Explicit Memory (and its subtypes)
    * Explicit Memory
        - A type of LTM that involves conscious recollection
            * You know you are trying to retrieve information from memory
            * e.g recall/recognize words, facts, pircture sfrom a prior set of items
    * Declarative Memory
        - Memory for facts that cna be stated (what/who/when; propositional)
            * E.g. Date of birth, name best friend, what does dog look like, who sang thriller, etc.
    * Semantic Memory
        - Theoretical knowledge idnependent of personal experience/context
        - Recognize otheres, historical events/people, info learned in school, general facts
    * Episodic Memory
        - Factual knowledg eof a personal (autobiographical) experience in a specific time & place ( your life experiences)
        - Remeber that trip to Paris (sights, smells, etc.. you experienced)
    
- Implicit Memory
    * Implicit memory:
        - Require retreieval of information from emmroy without conscious awareness
        - Task completion can indirectly indicate implicit memory
            * e.g word completion task
        - Also called non-declarative
    * 1. Procedural Memory
        - Memory for process (how to - action)
            * e.g: how to tie shoes, play an instrument, etc...
- Process-Dissociation Model (Jacoby 1991)
    * Implicit vs. Explicit Memory may both have a role in almost every response
        - But could they be seperable process in the brain?
    * **Process Dissociation Procedure**: Measures independent contribution of controlled & automatic memory processes
    * **Single Dissociation**: Show a single variable affects expression of one cognitive process but not the other
        - (e.g explit but not implicit memory)
        - Show that manipulating A affects performance on task X but not task Y (a single dissociation)
        - Ex. Lesion to one region affects only one process; while leasions to another region affects both, so the regions are not completly functionally independnt
        - Amensica pateients still show priming effects (implicit) even when they fail at recall (explicit)
            * H.M (medial temporal lobe damage) had intact working and procedural memory, but impaired declarative memory
        - Aging affects explicit (declarative) memory but not implicit memory(e.g learning rotary peursiut task)
        - Shift form auditory to visual presentation during encoding affects implicit but not explicit memory
    * **Double Dissociation**: Show that *two* variable have *opposite* effects on two cognitive processes (e.g. explicit & implicit memory)
        - Show that
            1. Maniuplating A affects performance on task X but not Y, and
            2. Mainuplating b affects performance on Y but not X
                - (as second or 'double' dissociation). Examples...
        - E.g Broca's patients couldn't speak but could understand, whereas we3nicke's patients couldn't understand but could produce speech
        - E.g Visual *identification* ("knowing *what*" pathway, from visual cortex to *temporal lobe) vs. *location("knowing *where*" pathway, from visual cortex to *parietal* lobe)
        - E.g hippocampus damage
        - Lessiont to *two speearte regions differentially affect* two processes. So they are at least in part functionally indpendnt
        - Hippocampus damage impairs *recollection* (remembering, detailed retrieveal) but not *familiarity* (knowing; feeling event was experience without recollection), whereas medial temporal lobe damage impairs familiarity but not recollection
        - Older adults show greater *implicit* memory for irrelevant information than younger adults, but younger show greater explicit memory for irrelevant information than older adults
- Models of Memory
    * Represent the ways that memory can be conceptualized
    * **Atkinson & shiffrin (1968) 3-Stage Model**
        - **Sensory Store**: stores relativly *large amounts* of info for *very brief* periods (before transfer to STM or loss)
            * **Iconic Store**: Visual sensory register, holds info for very short period (<1sec), in form of icons that look like the distal object
                - E.g tray name w/ sparkler - memory trace persists, but not physical trace
                * **Sperling (1960) Iconic Memory Research**
                    - **Whole report** procedure
                        * Flash a matrix of letters for 50 milliseconds
                        * Identify as many letters as possible
                        * Participants typically remebered 4 letters
                    - **Partial Report** Procedure
                        * Flash a matrix of letters for 50 millisceonds
                        * Partipants are told to report bottom row only
                            - Or any row requested
                        * Show iconic memory is:
                            - Larger than whole report first suggested
                * **Averbach & Coriell (1961) Iconic Memory Research**
                    - SHowed matrix for 50 mesc
                    - Place a small mark above a letter at different delays
                    - Results indicated that as many as 12 letters could be stored in sensory memory
                    - Backward visual masking
                * **Sesnsory Stores**   
                    - Iconic store or Visual Sensory Register
                    - Holds visual information for 250 msec longer
                    - Information held i pre-categorical
                    - Capacity - up to 12 items
                    - Information fades quickly
                * **Ecohic Stores (echo** or Audotiry Snsory Register
                    - Holds autidotryA
                * **Echoic Store** for auditory info (2-4 seconds)
        - **Short-Term Store**: 
            * Stores *limited amount* info for *somewhat longer periods* (usually about 30 seconds, unless rehearsed)
            * Our *winodw on the present*
                - HOlds everything you think about at any given moment
            * **Atention**
                - Attending to sensory store info *encodes* (transfers) it to *STM*
            * **Rehearsal**
                - Repeating info keeps it stored (*Maintained*) in STM
                    * Or **lose it** (usually within about 30 seconds)
            * **Retrieval**
            i
        - **Long-term Store**: Very large capacity, stores *lots of info* for *very lonbg times& , perhaps indefinetly
    - Research on Short-Term Memory
        * STM capacity also affected by
            - Closer to 4 possibly
    - Storage Capacity of Visual STM
        * USed non-verbal objects with different color and orientation features
            - (taps onlyu visual STM, vs. letter stimlui: *Verbal* or *visual* STM)
            3-4 objects.
            So capacity of visual STM **depends on # of objects, not # of features**
        * **Change Detection Task**: did the arry of objects change from sample to test array?

    - Long-Term Memory
        * LTM: System that stores information for very long periods of time ("archive")
        * Capacity
            - Thus far, appears limitless
            - No clear way to test limits
                * Can't 'max out' like STM
        * Duratoin
            - Potentially permanent
                * Wilder Penfield : electrically stimluated epilptic patients cerebral cortices
                * **Permastore** Very long term storage of some info (foriengn language, math)
- Levels of Processing Model of Memory
    * Craik & Lockhart (1972)
        - Not focused on X # of stores, but an encoding *continum*
            * May be an infinit # of levels of processing (LOP) to encode an item
            * Focus on process (vs. structure) of memory)
        - **Deeper processing** leads to better storage and retrieval
        - Elaborating according to meaning leads to strong memory (durable, retrievable memory trace)
        - Shallow processing emphasizes the *physical* features of the stimulus (creates fragile, quickly decaying memory trace)
        - **Mainteance Rehearsal**: Continuosuly repeating item (**rote** rehearsal)
            * Maintains info in STM only, no long-term retention
            * e.g repeating a phone # to hold it in STM until you dial (and forget) it; works for simple info
        - **Elaborative Rehearsal**: creating a semantic (meaning) code by associating new material with material already in LTM
            * e.g studying complex course material for an exam by focusing on comprehending its meaning, comin gup with examples, comparing/constrating, organizing imagery, etc..
    * Craik & Watikins (1973)
        - **Primacy Effect**
            * Better recall for early items in list
            * Suggests that encoding and recall from LTM dpeneds on *rehearsal* of infos
                - Also a **Recency Effect** for info recently put in STM
        - but does **type ** of rehearsal affect transfer from STM to LTM?
            * Instructed: At the end of each list, report the last word beginning with a particular letter (e.g "G")
            * Particpants listened to 27 lists of words but **not** told to memorize them
            * After all lists were presented, instructed to recall as many words as possible from all lists
            * IV: Varied the number of interviewing words (and time) between the words beginning with the target letter
        - Found no difference in recall for words with zero vs. 12 intervening words
        - So, recall of words was *independnt of the length of time it was matintined in STM*
        - Concluded:
            * Participants rehearsed without elabtorting on the meaning of the words, only focused on the initial consonant sound
                - Rehearitng at a *shallow maintence* level (vs. elaborative)
            * **Maintence Rehearsal** does not automatically lead to LTM storage

    * Craik & Tulving (1975)
        - Participants studied a list in 3 different ways
        - Structural: Is the word in **capital letters**? (focus on letter case = structure)
        - Phonemic: DOes the word *ryhme* with dog? (focus on acuostic properties)
        - Semantic: Does the word *fit in* this sentence? The ____ is delicious.
    * Criticisms of LOP Model
        - How does it work? (unspecified mechanisms)
            * How do we measure "deeper" objectivly?
                - Circular definition: "deeper" level <-> better remembered
                - Deeper processing takes more effort - so does *effort level* explain it?
            * Doesn't explain: "**Transfer appropriate processing**"
                - Morris, Bransford, and Franks (1977)
                - Two processing tasks: semantic vs. rhyme
                - Two types of tests: standard yes/no recongition vs. rhyme test
                - Memory performance also dpends on the **match between type of encoding process and type of retrieval test**
    * Back to STM: Lmitations of "Short Term Memory' Model
        - Taditional 3-stage model view: STM as short-term **storage** mechanism
        - But the way we use memory in the moment includes both **storage** and **active processes**:
        - Transferring info between STM and LTM:
            * e.g: memorizing a phone number
            * Transfer info from STm to LTM during encoding, back to STM during retrieval
        - Comprehending a conversation
            * "I'd like to order a large pizza with ham and pineapple."
            * "Sorry, were out of pineapple. Would you like mushrooms instead?"
            * Q: What would you be substituted with mushrooms? Must sore 1s tsentence while processing 2nd to be able to answer
        - Doing Computations:
            * demo: multiply 43 times 6 in your head
            * so requires **storage** (hold) and **active** processes (carry, multiply)
        - So STM storage doesn't explain how we both hold and work with currently active information
    * Baddeleys' Working Memory Model
        - Working Memory:
            * Holds the fleeting STM (lost in 30 secs w/o rehereasal to LTM) and the msot recently activated (concious) content of LTM
            * Allows us to temporarily **store* ifnromation and **activly process** it
        - Baddeley's WM model has several elements...
            * 3 "Slave" Systems
            * **Articulatory Loop** (aka Phonological Loop)
                - Converts visual alngauge to an auditory code through silen artiuclation
                - Maintains acoustic (sound & speech) information for a short time
                    * **Subvocal Rehearsal**: "inner speech" revives trace & keeps info in WM
                        - "**Articualtory Supression**" = Inhibition of subvocal rehearsal
                            * E.g Repeat a number while trying to lear a list of words
                    * **Phonological Storage**: "Inner ear" briefly holds auditory memory trace
            * **Visuo-Spatial Sketch Pad**
                - Used for amintaing and processing visual & spatial information
                    * Brief memory fr shapes, colors, location & speed of objects, planning movement
            * **Episodic Buffer**
                - "Used for storage of a multimodal code, holding an integrated episode bwetween systems using different codes"
                    * Binds/integrates current and LTM visual, spatial, phonological info to create unitary episodic represenation that makes sense to us
            * All 3 controlled by:
                - **Central Executive**
                    * Controls slave systems
                    * Focuses attention on relevant items and inhibiting irrelevant ones
                    * **Plans** sequence of tasks to accomplish goals, schedules processes in complex tasks, often **switches attention** between different parts
                    * **Updates** and **chekcs** content to determine next step in sequence of parts
        - Support for Baddely
            * Pariticpants stueied two differnt list types
            * 1 syllable: wit, sum, harm, bay, top
            * 5 syllables: univesity, opportunity, aluminum
            * Reating rate seemed to determine recall perfoamcnce
            * Supports conceptulatization of articulary loop
        - Support for Visuo Spatial Sketch Pafd
            * Dual-Task Paradigm
            * Sketchpad can be disrupted by requiring partipants to tap repeatedly a specified pattern of keyboard keys or locations while using mental imagery at the same time
- Back to LTM
    * 4. Tulving's Multiple-Memory Systems Model
        - Suggests multiple systems involved in info sotage and retrieval
        - Tulving (1972) Distinuighsed
            * Semantic Memory
                - General knowledge
                - Facts, definitions, concepts, ideas, historical dates
            * Episodic Memory
                - Autobiographical event memories (your first kiss, your 6th birthday)
            * Procedural Memory
                - How to do something (skiing, biking, tying your shoes)
        - Nyberg, Cabeza, & Tulving (1996) "Hera"
            * Hemispheric Encoding/Retrival Asysmetry Mdodel
            * PET technology to look at episodic and semantic memory
            * Asked peoplt to engage in semnatic or episodic memory tasks while being monitored by PET
                - Episodic: "Remeber the tim eyou last saw your best friend"
                - Semantic: "Rember your best friend's name..."
            * Results
                - Some evidence of **double dissociation**
                - Left prefrontal hemisphere more activate in **semantic** memory retrieval
    * Multiple Memory Systems -- other taxonomies
        - Squire (1986)
            * Declarative
                - Semantic & Episodic
            * Non-Declarative
                - Procedural skills, priming, conditioning, nonassociative (habituation/sensitiazation)
        - Schacter (200)
            * Proposed 5 memory systems: episodic, semantic, perceptual, procedural, working
                - Right prefrontal more active in **episodic** memory retrieval
- Connectisit Perspective
    * Parallel distributed processing model
        - Computer & nueral tandem networks working in **parallel (vs. single-computer or 3-stores memory model: serial processes)
        - **Memory**: involves a network of distrubuted (not local) representations based on connections between units
        - **Learning**: gradual changes in **connection stength** by experience.
        - **Spreading Activation**: Simultaneous activation (priming) of multiple links among nodes in a network.
        - **Working Memory**: activated part of LTM
        - Evidence: priming, procedural memory
        - Less evidence: Recall/recongiiton of single epsidoe/exposure to semantic info
        - Controversy: Can PDP models predict *order* and *purposefulness* of human thought?
- Koriat & GoldSmith (1996)
    * Suggest a *change in the metaphores* used to conceptualize memory
        - **"Storehouse"** Metaphore
            * Memory as *repository*
            * Leads to questions of how much? (quantity)
    * Propose a **"correspondence"** metaphore
        - Emphasizes **function** of memory
            * How memory works in *real world*
            * Purpose: **vehicle** for interaction with enviroment

- **Exceptional Memory**
    * Case studies of **mnemonists**
    * Studies of **skilled memory**
    * **Eidetic (photographic) memory**
        - Ability to recall images, sounds or objectsw in *high volume* with extreme *accuracy*
    * Case Studies

            * Relied on visual imagery
                - E.g 1 = proud man, 3 = gloomy person
            * But **synesthesia** symptoms interfered elsewhere
                - Diffuculty following conversation (saw blurs of sensations), abstract concepts (infinity - no image), memory intrusions
        - **Rajan Mahadevan
            * Can recite pi to 31,811 places
            * Memorize matrices up to 20x20 digits

            * Amneisiacs show:
                - Poor **recongition** memory (explicit)
                    * Don't remeber having seen the word list (stimuli)
                - Normal **priming** (implicit)
                    * Complete the word fragments
    * Alzheimer's Disease
        - Leads to memory loss and dementia in older population
        - Atrophy of the cortical tissue, formal diagnosis only after death and autopsy
            * Alzheimer brains shows abnormal fibers that appear to be **tangles** of brain tissue and senile **plaques**
                - (patches of degenerative nerve engindings)
                - These may lead to disruption of impulses in neurons
                - Low acetylcholine in hippocampus
        - Cases over the age of 65 are labeled 'late onset'
            * Incidence rate increases with age:
                - 1% per year in ages 70-75 (30-50% of adults over 70 have symptoms)
                - 6% per year in ages 80-85 (50% of adults over 80 have symptoms)
                - Cause is unclear, may be gene x enviroment interaction
        - Early onset is rare but can affect those in their mid 30s and in middle age
            * Dominant genetic mutation
        - Symptoms:
            * Gradual, Continous, Irreversible
                - Memory Loss
                    * Episodeic goes first, then also semantic
                - Problems doing familiar tasks
                - Problems with lan guage
                - Trouble knowing the time, date, or place
                - Poor or decreased judgment
                - Porblems with abstract thinking
                - Misplacing things often, such as keys
                - Changes in mood and behavior
                - Changes in personality
            * Eventually causes death
            * Some drugs might slow progression a bit:
                - donepezil (Aricept)
                    * Slow acetylcholine destruction
                - memantine (Namenda)
                    * Inhibits chemical that overxcites and destroys neurons
    * Korsakoff's syndrome
        - Alchohol consumption disrupts serotonin
        - Short-term effects; Inhibits memory formation
        - Other untoward effects 
        - Long-term alcohol abuse leads to Korsakoff's syndrome
        - Inhibits body's ability to absorb thiamine (Vitamine B1)
        - Damage to thalamus & hypotahalamus & other areas
        - Mostly anterograde amnesia (sometimes w/ some retrograde)
        - Treatment with Thiamine and other drugs
            * Slow, often incomplete recovery
- Hoppocampus and Memory
    * Critical for **integratioN** and **consolidation** of memories
        - Along with amygdala
        - Transferring newly synthesized info to longer-term storage
    * Essential for **Declarative** memory
    * Other structures regulate non-declarative memory
        - (skills and habits, conditioning, priming) 
        - Basal ganglia: Procedural knowledge
        - Cerebellum:
