Chapter 3
=========
- **Constructive Perception Thories** (**Top-Down**)
    * **Basics**
        - People actively construct perceptions using information based on expectations
        - Bottom up theories don't account for **context effects**
            * Requires **Top-Down** Processing
        - Higher order processing need to build perception
        - Occurs quickly
        - Involves making inferences, guessing from experience
            * Basing one perceitopn on another
    * **Configural-Superiroity Effect**
        - Objects presented in context area are easer to recognize than objects presented alone
        - Task: Spot the different stimulus & press button
            * People pick out configured stimuli faster
- So **Top-Down** or **Bottom-Up**?
    * Both. 
    * Holistic - When seeing (notice the keys)
    * Analytics - To help us act upon (grab them)
- **Distinct Brain Visual Pathways**
    * What/Where Hypothesis (Ungerleider & Haxby, 1994):
        * One path for **identifying** objectgs
            - The "Ventral" stream, object discrimination/recognition
            - **Temporal** lobe lesions in monkeys
                * Can indicate _where_ but not _what_ object is
        * Another for **sptially locating** objects
            - "Dorsal" stream, object location
            - **Parietal** Lobe lesions in monkeys
                * Can indicate what but not where object is
    * What/How Hypthesis (Goodale & Milner, 2004)
        - Two pathways:
            1. What the object is (identity)
            2. How it **functions** (vs. where it is)
                - Helps us primates **move** and act n objects in our enviroment
        - Argues the "where" (spatial lcoation) info is preesnt in both pathways, but operates dirrecntly in each:
            * IN "what" path: gives conscious awareness of object identity
                * Object-centered, viewpoint invariant, for sake of representatin over time
            * In "how" path: gives unconciosus knowledge of object location and shape
                - Immediate, "egocentric", viewer-centreed, for sake of action (grab cup)
- More on **Deficits** in Perception
    * **Agnosia**
        - Inability to recognize and identify objects or persons
            * Despite having knowledge of the characteristics of the objects or persons
            * Which visual pathway is affected?
                - **The What pathway**
    * **Posopagnosia**
        - Inability to recognize faces, sometime sone's own
        - Can't recognize person from face
        - Knows a face is a face
        - Can recognizre individuals from voice, gait, etc.
        - Can recognize non-face objects
        - Can discriminate whether two faces are same or different
            * (receognition/identification -- not perception)
    * **Simultagnosia**
        - Normal visual fields, yet act blind
        - Perieces only one stimulus at a time -- single word or object
    * **Spatial Agnosia**
        - Cannot navigate in even familiar enviroment
        - Get lost
    * **Auditory Agnosia**
        - Cannot recognize certain sounds
        - Can't tell if two melodies are same/different
        - Hearing is fine
    * **Color Agnosia**
        - Can see colors are different
        - Cannot name the colors
    * **Ataxia**
        - Disorder of coordinated movement
        - Distruption of the "how" pathway
        - **Optic Ataxia**
            * Cannot use visiual system to guide movement
            * Unable to reach for items
                - Fumbling ot get key into keyhole
                - But in broad daylight (can visually perceive "what") rather than in the dark
- **Attention**
    * The *mean* by which we *actively process* a *limited amount* of information
    * From the vast amounts available via sensation, memory, and other mental processes
    * We have *limited* mental (cognitive) resources, necessitating selectirivity
    * Focus helps with *fast*, *accurate responding*to stimuli
    * Attention helps with **memory** (salient info)
    * Functions:
        - Detecting (vigilance)
        - Searching for (search)
        - Selectirng Stimlui for Further Processing (Selective Attention)
        - Allocating our limited processing resources (divided attention)
- **Consciousness**
    - The feeling of awareness and content of awareness (info you're aware of manipulating)
    - Both conscious and preconscious attention:
        * Preconscious attention: Process info without awareness
            - E.g Wiring your name while doing something else
            - Priming, tip of tounge, habituation, automatization
        * Harder to study preconsious processes
            - We lack of awareness of them
        * **Conscious attention** helps
            - Monitor our interactions with enviroment
            - LInk past (memories) and present (sensations) to give continuity of experience, identity
- **Preconscious Attention**
    * Attending to items that lie outside our conscious awareness.
    * Some can be amde conscious, some not:
        - Stored memories?
        - Sensations?
        - Reading?
        - Driving?
        - Subliminal Messages?
- **Priming**
    * 1st Bread
    * 2nd Butter
        - How quickly do you process the second word?
    * Priming = prosenting stimlus that biasses how a subsequent stimlus (problem/target) is processed
        - Recognition of stimlui (proces=targets is influenced by prior presentiaotn of same or simliar stimui) (
    * Priming can be conscious or preconscious
        - Priming by subliminal stimlui provides good evidence of preconsious attention
    * Facilitative Priming: Given stimlus increased likelihood that a subsequent related/identitacal stimlus will be processed
        - Target stimlui proceed fastr if prceeded by a related word
    * Negative priming:
        - Stimlus decreases likelihood of processing the next related stimlus
