Chapter 3
=========
- **Constructive Perception Thories** (**Top-Down**)
    * **Basics**
        - People actively construct perceptions using information based on expectations
        - Bottom up theories don't account for **context effects**
            * Requires **Top-Down** Processing
        - Higher order processing need to build perception
        - Occurs quickly
        - Involves making inferences, guessing from experience
            * Basing one perceitopn on another
    * **Configural-Superiroity Effect**
        - Objects presented in context area are easer to recognize than objects presented alone
        - Task: Spot the different stimulus & press button
            * People pick out configured stimuli faster
- So **Top-Down** or **Bottom-Up**?
    * Both. 
    * Holistic - When seeing (notice the keys)
    * Analytics - To help us act upon (grab them)
- **Distinct Brain Visual Pathways**
    * What/Where Hypothesis (Ungerleider & Haxby, 1994):
        * One path for **identifying** objectgs
            - The "Ventral" stream, object discrimination/recognition
            - **Temporal** lobe lesions in monkeys
                * Can indicate _where_ but not _what_ object is
        * Another for **sptially locating** objects
            - "Dorsal" stream, object location
            - **Parietal** Lobe lesions in monkeys
                * Can indicate what but not where object is
    * What/How Hypthesis (Goodale & Milner, 2004)
        - Two pathways:
            1. What the object is (identity)
            2. How it **functions** (vs. where it is)
                - Helps us primates **move** and act n objects in our enviroment
        - Argues the "where" (spatial lcoation) info is preesnt in both pathways, but operates dirrecntly in each:
            * IN "what" path: gives conscious awareness of object identity
                * Object-centered, viewpoint invariant, for sake of representatin over time
            * In "how" path: gives unconciosus knowledge of object location and shape
                - Immediate, "egocentric", viewer-centreed, for sake of action (grab cup)
- More on **Deficits** in Perception
    * **Agnosia**
        - Inability to recognize and identify objects or persons
            * Despite having knowledge of the characteristics of the objects or persons
            * Which visual pathway is affected?
                - **The What pathway**
    * **Posopagnosia**
        - Inability to recognize faces, sometime sone's own
        - Can't recognize person from face
        - Knows a face is a face
        - Can recognizre individuals from voice, gait, etc.
        - Can recognize non-face objects
        - Can discriminate whether two faces are same or different
            * (receognition/identification -- not perception)
    * **Simultagnosia**
        - Normal visual fields, yet act blind
        - Perieces only one stimulus at a time -- single word or object
    * **Spatial Agnosia**
        - Cannot navigate in even familiar enviroment
        - Get lost
    * **Auditory Agnosia**
        - Cannot recognize certain sounds
        - Can't tell if two melodies are same/different
        - Hearing is fine
    * **Color Agnosia**
        - Can see colors are different
        - Cannot name the colors
    * **Ataxia**
        - Disorder of coordinated movement
        - Distruption of the "how" pathway
        - **Optic Ataxia**
            * Cannot use visiual system to guide movement
            * Unable to reach for items
                - Fumbling ot get key into keyhole
                - But in broad daylight (can visually perceive "what") rather than in the dark
- **Attention**
    * The *mean* by which we *actively process* a *limited amount* of information
    * From the vast amounts available via sensation, memory, and other mental processes
    * We have *limited* mental (cognitive) resources, necessitating selectirivity
    * Focus helps with *fast*, *accurate responding*to stimuli
    * Attention helps with **memory** (salient info)
    * Functions:
        - Detecting (vigilance)
        - Searching for (search)
        - Selectirng Stimlui for Further Processing (Selective Attention)
        - Allocating our limited processing resources (divided attention)
- **Consciousness**
    - The feeling of awareness and content of awareness (info you're aware of manipulating)
    - Both conscious and preconscious attention:
        * Preconscious attention: Process info without awareness
            - E.g Wiring your name while doing something else
            - Priming, tip of tounge, habituation, automatization
        * Harder to study preconsious processes
            - We lack of awareness of them
        * **Conscious attention** helps
            - Monitor our interactions with enviroment
            - LInk past (memories) and present (sensations) to give continuity of experience, identity
- **Preconscious Attention**
    * Attending to items that lie outside our conscious awareness.
    * Some can be amde conscious, some not:
        - Stored memories?
        - Sensations?
        - Reading?
        - Driving?
        - Subliminal Messages?
- **Priming**
    * 1st Bread
    * 2nd Butter
        - How quickly do you process the second word?
    * Priming = prosenting stimlus that biasses how a subsequent stimlus (problem/target) is processed
        - Recognition of stimlui (proces=targets is influenced by prior presentiaotn of same or simliar stimui) (
    * Priming can be conscious or preconscious
        - Priming by subliminal stimlui provides good evidence of preconsious attention
    * Facilitative Priming: Given stimlus increased likelihood that a subsequent related/identitacal stimlus will be processed
        - Target stimlui proceed fastr if prceeded by a related word
    * Negative priming:
        - Stimlus decreases likelihood of processing the next related stimlus
- **Controlled vs. Automatic Processing**
    * Automatic Processing
        - Requires no conscious control
        - OUtside awareness
        - Parallel processing (all at once)
        - No effort or attention
    * Controlled Processing
        - Requires conscious control, awareness
        - Serial: one step at a time
        - Effort, attention, intention
- **Habituation**
    * Decrease in responsiveness when we're repeatedly exposed to a stimlus
    * As we become accustom, we pay less attention to it
        - The simples and most ibiquitous form of learning
        - Its non-associative
            * Response to exposure to a single stimulus
            * (Vs. associative/classical conditionging: link formed, CS to UCS)
        - Can be adaptive
            * Allows ut to respond only to changing/novel stimuli (similar to sensory adaptation)
            * Lowers demands on concsious attention
                - Attending to lecture vs. breathing, buzzin projector, rustling papers, etc..
                - Habituation deficits seen in tinnitus ear ringing), schizophrenia, aging
            * Sometimes maladaptive
                - Stop noticing noise, pollustants, stress?
    * Usually an automatic process , but NOT same as **sensory adaptation**
        - Can exter some control over by consciously attending
            * Eg. listen to fan,f eel the pen in your hand
        - Affected by length, number or recency of prior exposures to stimulus (vs. intensity)
            * Can habituate even to a loud fan
        - Sensory receptors still respond to stimulation, but signal not sent to cortex (unattended)
    * Whether we habituatie is influenced by
        - Stimlus variation (in time, not complexity)
            * Less habituation to music or TV than steady drone of a fan
        - Arousal: one's level of physiological excitation, resonvity, and readiness for action, relative to baseline
    * Habituation seen in simpler organisms
        - Aplysia Californica (SeaSlug Molusk):
            * Touching slug's siphon causes gill withdrawl
            * Repeatedly tickling slug's siphon leads to less gill withdrawal over time
            * Not sensory adaptation or faitigue
                - No change in snsory or motor neuron activity
                    * The siphon haptic receptors don't become insensitive to touch
                    * Gills don't get fatigued and unable to withdraw
                - Same habituation response if bypass siphon haptic receptors and directly stimlate the motor nerver
                - So, seem to pay less attention to the tickling
                - Still, sea slugs have no central nervous system
- **Dishabituation**
    * Change in familiar stimlu causes one to notice it again
        - If clock breaks, suddenly owner notices the clock isn't chiming
        - Smokers who quit suddenly notice how much their clothes smell of smoke
- **Habituation/Dishabituation Paradigm**
    * Habituation (mental process) used as a method/procedure
    * Allows psychologists to test whether non-verbal subjects can detect change in a stimlus, and what type
        - Infants, animals, comatose patients
    * Subject is exposed repereadtly to s stimlus to habituation, then stimlus is changed
        - Color, pattern, size, form, etc..
    * Measure arousal level
        - Looking time; change in EEG, hear rate, or blood prssure
    * **Habituation** (reduction in looking time) is only possible if the usbject can percieve and remeber (learn) the stimlus over time
    * **Dishabituation** (incerase in looking time) is only possible if the subject can compare the stimlus to the original stimlus and detect a change
        - Requires perception, attention, memory
- **Four functions of Conscious Attention**
    * Signal Detection
        - Trying to prercieve presence of a signal (target sitmlus) amid noise
    * Visual Search
        - Actively scan enviroment to find taqrgets among distractors
    * Selective Attention   
        - Focus on one aspect of a scene, ginoring other aspects
    * Divided Attention
        - Attend to more than one stimlus at a time
- **Signal Detection Theory** (SDT)
    * Signal Detection: Detecting the presence of a singal (target stimlus) through noise/uncertainty
        - * Eg. radar, shower/phone rining, cancer, ambulance siren
    * Signal Detection Theory: used to measure how we percieve, attend, decide under conditions of uncertaainty
        - Contributing factors
            * Experience/training, physiological state (fatigue)
            * Response bias:
                - Expectations (how much anticipate signal)
                - Value of signal: cost/benefit ratios
                - Deciion Present, Signal Absent = Type I error ( false positive)
                - Decision Absent, Signal Present = Type II error (False negative)
                - Right (detect/reject) vs. wrong (miss/false arlarm) decisions
            * We can change detectin thresholds, but... tradeoffs
                - Sensitive airpot screens, medical test:
                    * More hits but also more false alarams
- Vigilance and SDT
    * Vigilance = attending to sa set of stimu over a length of time in order to detect a target signal
        - difficult! (misses, false alrams)
        - yet important!
    * Decreases rapidly over time (fatigue), thus misses and false alrams increase
- Conjunctive vs. Feature Search
    * Upper box : Feature Search
        -  Simply search for the feature
    * LOwer box: Conjunction Search
        - How do things conjoin
    * Treisman's Feature-Integration Theory
        - Explains relative ease of feature searches & diffuculty of conjunctive search
            * Feature Search: Invidual Feature processing is done in parallel
                - Simultaneous processing is done on the whole display and if feature is present -- we detect it
            * Conjunctived Searching: Requires attention to the integration or combination of the features
                - Attention to particular combination of feature smuswt be done sequentially to detect presence of a certain combination
- Similarity Theory
    * Similarity between targets and distractors is important
        - NOT the number of features to be combined
    * More shared features = more diffucult to detect a target
- **Guided Search**
    * Cave and Wolf (1990)
    * All searches have 2 phases
        - Parallel phase
            * Simulatenous activation of representation (mental map) of all potentional targets
            * Base don simulatentous activation of all co-joined (conjunctive) feature sin a target
        - Serial Stage
            * Evaluate each feature based on evel of activation (helps el;iminate distractors)
- **Selectivity of Attention**  
    * Cocktail Party Problem
        - How are we able tofllow one conservation in the presence of other conversations?
    * Cherry's Shadowing Technique
        - Attended Ear
        - Unattended Ear
        - Binaural = both ears same two messages
        - Dichotic = Each ear gets a different message
        - Noticed in unattended ear:
            * Change in generder of speaker
            * Change in tone
        - Did not notic ein unattended ear:
            * Change in language
            * Changed topic, same speaker
            * if speech wa splayed backwards
        - Some info get sthrough, but not all:
            * Notice **physical/sensory** changes
            * NOT deeper **semenatic** (meaning) changes
- **Models of Slective Attention**
    * Do they have a **filter**?
       - that prevents certainstimuli from nbeing processed further?
    * Where doe the filter occur?
        - Eraly on, at sensory/eprceptual elvel, or later, after some semnatic processing of meaning?
- **Broadbent's "bottleneck" Model**
    * First flow diagram of mind (1958, cognitive revoltuion)
        - Suggest info processed in sequential series of stages
    * explains Cherry's dichotic listening findings:
        - HOw we selectivly attend, what happens to (un) atttended stimuli...
    * Only one sensory channel is allowed to proceed(yellow)
    * Stimuli filtered at **snsory** level
        - **Filter**:
            * Lets through only to-be-attended message
            * Based on **physical** characacteristics
