Chapter 3
=========
- **Constructive Perception Thories** (**Top-Down**)
    * **Basics**
        - People actively **construct perceptions**
            * Using **info based on expectations**
        - Bottom up theories don't account for **context effects**
            * Requires **Top-Down** Processing
        - Higher order processing need to build perception
        - Occurs quickly
        - Involves making inferences, guessing from experience
            * Basing one perceitopn on another
    * **Configural-Superiroity Effect**
        - Objects **presented in context area **
            * **Easier to recognize** than objects presented alone
        - Task: Spot the different stimulus & press button
            * People pick out configured stimuli faster
- So **Top-Down** or **Bottom-Up**?
    * Both. 
    * Holistic
        - When seeing 
        - (notice the keys)
    * Analytics
        - To help us act upon 
        - (grab them)
- **Distinct Brain Visual Pathways**
    * **What/Where** Hypothesis (**Ungerleider & Haxby**, 1994):
        * One path for **identifying** objectgs
        * The "Ventral" stream, object discrimination/recognition
        * **Temporal** lobe lesions in monkeys
            - Can indicate _where_ but not _what_ object is
        * Another for **sptially locating** objects
            - "Dorsal" stream, object location
            - **Parietal** Lobe lesions in monkeys
                * Can indicate what but not where object is
    * **What/How** Hypthesis (**Goodale & Milner**, 2004)
        - Two pathways:
            * What the **object is** (identity)
            * How it **functions** (vs. where it is)
        * Helps us primates **move** 
            - And act with objects in our enviroment
        - Argues the "where" (spatial lcoation) info 
            - Is preesnt in both pathways
            - But operates dirrecntly in each:
        - IN "what" path
            * gives conscious awareness of object identity
            * Object-centered, 
            * viewpoint invariant
                - For sake of representatin over time
        * In "how" path
            * Gives unconciosus knowledge of object location 
                - and shape
            * Immediate, "egocentric", viewer-centreed
                - for sake of action (grab cup)
- **Deficits** in Perception
    * **Agnosia**
        - **Inability** to 
            * **Recognize** and 
            * **Identify** objects or persons
        - Despite having knowledge of the characteristics 
            * of the objects or persons
        - Which visual pathway is affected?
            * **The What pathway**
    * **Posopagnosia**
        - **Inability to recognize faces**
            * Sometime one's own
        - Can't recognize person from face
        - Knows a face is a face
        - Can recognize individuals from 
            * Voice, gait, etc.
        - Can recognize non-face objects
        - Can discriminate whether two faces 
            * Are same or different
            * (receognition/identification -- not perception)
    * **Simultagnosia**
        - Normal visual fields
            * Yet act blind
        - Perieces only one stimulus at a time
            * Single word or object
    * **Spatial Agnosia**
        - Cannot navigate 
            * Even familiar enviroment
        - Get lost
    * **Auditory Agnosia**
        - Cannot recognize certain sounds
        - Can't tell if 
            * Two melodies are same/different
        - Hearing is fine
    * **Color Agnosia**
        - Can see colors are different
        - Cannot name the colors
    * **Ataxia**
        - Disorder of coordinated movement
        - **Distruption** of the **"how" pathway**
        - **Optic Ataxia**
            * Cannot use visiual system to guide movement
            * **Unable** to **reach for items**
                - Fumbling to get key into keyhole
                - But in broad daylight (can visually perceive "what") rather than in the dark
