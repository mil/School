Chapter 3
=========
- **Constructive Perception Thories** (**Top-Down**)
    * **Basics**
        - People actively **construct perceptions**
            * Using **info based on expectations**
        - Bottom up theories don't account for **context effects**
            * Requires **Top-Down** Processing
        - Higher order processing need to build perception
        - Occurs quickly
        - Involves making inferences, guessing from experience
            * Basing one perceitopn on another
    * **Configural-Superiroity Effect**
        - Objects **presented in context area**
            * **Easier to recognize** than objects presented alone
        - Task: Spot the different stimulus & press button
            * People pick out configured stimuli faster
            * Ex. The Triangle lines
- So **Top-Down** or **Bottom-Up**?
    * Both. 
    * **Holistic**
        - When seeing 
        - (notice the keys)
    * **Analytics**
        - To help us act upon 
        - (grab them)
- **Distinct Brain Visual Pathways**
    * **What/Where** Hypothesis (**Ungerleider & Haxby**, 1994):
        * One path for **identifying** objectgs
        * The **"Ventral" Stream**
            * Object discrimination/recognition
        * **Temporal lobe lesions** in monkeys
            - Can indicate _where_ but not _what_ object is
        * Another for **sptially locating** objects
            - "Dorsal" stream, object location
            - **Parietal** Lobe lesions in monkeys
                * Can indicate what but not where object is
    * **What/How** Hypothesis (**Goodale & Milner**, 2004)
        - Two pathways:
            * What the **object is** (identity)
            * How it **functions** (vs. where it is)
        * Helps us primates **move** 
            - And **act with objects** in our **enviroment**
        - Argues the "where" (spatial location) info 
            - Is **preesnt in both pathways**
            - But **operates directly in each**
        - In **"What" Path**
            * Gives **Conscious Awareness** of **object identity**
            * **Object-centered**
            * Viewpoint invariant
                - For sake of representatin over time
        * In **"How" Path**
            * Gives unconciosus knowledge of 
                - **Object Location**
                - And **shape**
            * **Immediate**, **"egocentric"**, **viewer-centreed**
                - For **sake of action**
                    * (grab cup)
- **Deficits** in Perception
    * **Agnosia**
        - **Inability** to 
            * **Recognize** and 
            * **Identify** Objects or Persons
        - **Despite** having **knowledge** of the **characteristics **
            * Of the objects or persons
        - Which visual pathway is affected?
            * **The What Pathway**
    * **Posopagnosia**
        - **Inability to recognize faces**
            * Sometime one's own
        - **Can't recognize person from face**
        - Knows a face is a face
        - Can recognize individuals from 
            * Voice, gait, etc.
        - Can recognize non-face objects
        - Can discriminate whether two faces 
            * Are same or different
            * (receognition/identification -- not perception)
    * **Simultagnosia**
        - **Normal visual fields**
        - But the person **acts blind**
        - Percieves only one stimulus at a time
            * Single word or object
    * **Spatial Agnosia**
        - **Cannot navigate **
            * Even familiar enviroment
        - **Get lost**
    * **Auditory Agnosia**
        - **Cannot recognize certain sounds**
        - **Can't tell** if 
            * **Two melodies are same/different*
        - Hearing is fine
    * **Color Agnosia**
        - Can see **colors are different**
        - **Cannot name the colors**
    * **Associative Agnosia**
        - Abilty to represent objects visually
        - Cannot use info to recognize things
    * **Ataxia**
        - **Disorder of coordinated movement**
        - **Disruption** of the **"How" Pathway**
        - **Optic Ataxia**
            * **Cannot use visiual system** to **guide movement**
            * **Unable** to **reach for items**
                - **Fumbling to get key into keyhole**
                - But in broad daylight (can visually perceive "what") 
                    * Rather than in the dark
