Chapter 6 - Memory Processes
============================
- Memory **Process**
    * **Encoding**
        - **Acquire & transform** sensory input into representation in memory
    * **Storage**
        - **Retain** the encoded information (represenations) in memory
    * **Retrieval**
        - **Gain access** to information in memory
- **Encoding**
    * **Definition**
        - **Encoding (N)**
            * The way **information is represented in memory**
            * The **form** in which it is stored
        - **Encoding (V)**
            * **Process** by which we **acquire info**
            * Transfer it into a memory
        - e.g from a class lecture
    * **Types of Codes**
        - **Acoustic (Auditory)** Code
            * Based on what the stimulus **sounds like**
            * E.g the sound of the professors voice & words
    - **Semantic** Code
        * Based on what the **stimulus means**
        * E.g Meaning of what the profressor is talking about
    - **Visual** Code
        * Based on what the stimulus **looks like**
            - (imagry)
        * E.g What the project slide images and text look like
- **Encoding** into **Short-Term Memory (STM)**
    * **Basics**
        - Type of code may **rely on type of task**
        - STM refers to memory that is held temporally
        - Usually 30 sec
    * **Acoustic Encoding** in **STM** (**Conrad** 1964)
        - **Visually present series of letters** briefly.
        - Once series is complete
            * Immediatly **write the letters** viewed
        - Errors
            * Most Common **Errors** 
                * **Letters** that **sounded like targets**
            - **Usually Not Visual Errors** 
                * Letters that look like targets
        - Concluded
            * Code for STM is **Acoustic/Auditory**
        - Another example: 
            * Look up a phone number (visual stimulus)
            * Repeat the sound of the numbers in our heads (acoustic rehearsal) 
                - To keep them in STM for serial recall
        - But is all STM acoustic?
    * **Semantic/Acoustic Encoding** in **STM** (**Shulman** 1970)
        - Paricipants *viewed* **10-word lists**
        - Given **Recognition Test**
            * Did you see this word? 
        - Recognition Test used **Visually** Written Probe Words as:
            * **Homonyms** 
                - **Sounds** are **same**
                - But **different meaning**
                - eg. "bawl" for "ball"
            * OR **Synonyms**
                - **Sounds different**
                - But the **same** in **meaning**
                - eg. "talk" for "speak"
            * OR **Identical** 
                - Sound and meaning are same 
                - To the original word 
                - eg. "kite" and "kite"
        - **Prediction**
            * If: Encode only **acoustically**
                - Then: **Homonyms** (same sounds) **produce more errors** than synoyms (diffent sounds)
            * If we encode **Semantically**
                - Then: **Synonyms** (same meanings) **produce errors** than homonyms 
                - (even though they sound different)
        - Results:
            * **Homonym and Synonym** probes produced **similar error rates**
            * Suggests **equal amount** of **acoustic and semantic** encoding in STM

    * **Visual Encoding** in **STM** (**Posner & Keele** 1967)
        - Atleast some memory tasks **require visual codes**
            * e.g recall a diagram, a map, a floor plan
        - Letter matching task
            * Two letters seperated by brief interval
            * Participant indicates if same letter followed the first
        - **Three Trial Types**
            * "A" -> "a" 
                - Yes (Same sound, different image)
            * "A" -> "A"
                - Yes (Same sound, same image)
            * "A" -> "M"
                - No (Differnt sound, different image)
        - **Predict Difference** in RT between first two trials 
            * If **acoustic coding only**
                - No: both involve same sound
            * If **visual coding**
                - Same sound, just **BLANK**
        - **Results**
            - Participants were **faster** when
                * **Letters** were the **same visually** (a-a)
            - Participants were slower when
                * Letters were not the same visually (A-a)
            - Thus: **Visual** code also **present in STM**

- **Encoding** into **Long-Term Memory (LTM)**
    * Basics
        - Types of code may rely on **Type of task**
        - LTM refers to memory that may be held *permanently*
    * **Semantic Encoding** in **LTM** (**Grossman & Eagle** 1970)
        - Participants given **41 different words** to study
        - **Recognition test** given **after 5 minute delay**
            * Was (word) in the list?
        - Distractors 
            - Half distractors were **synonyms**
            - Half distractors **were not semantically related**
            - 9 distractors were semnatically related
                - e.g Word = "boat" 
                - Distractor = "ship"
        - Results
            * **False Alarm** Rate:
                - 1.83 synonynms
                - 1.05 of unrelated (non-synonyms)
        - Supports **semantic encoding** in LTM

    * More **Semantic Encoding** in **LTM** (**Bousfield** 1953)
        - Had people learn a **list of 60 words** with 
            * 15 Animals, 
            * 15 Professions
            * 15 Vegtables
            * 15 Person names **mixed in**
        - Used **free recall **
        - In Recall, people naturally **clumped words** into 
            * **4 Semantic Groups**
    * **Visual Encoding** in **LTM** (**Frost** 1972)
        - Participants **studied 16 drawings**
            * Pictures of clothes, animals, vehicles, furniture
        - **Manipulated**
            * **Visual Orientation** 
                * Same or Different
            * And **Semantic Category**
                - Left, Right, Horizontal, Vertical angles
        - After a **delay**, participants asked:
            * Had they studied an object **with the same name** as the **test object**
            * Reaction time was measured
        - **Results**
            * **Particpants responded faster** 
                * To identical drawings 
            * **Participants responsed slower**
                * To drawing in different orientation
        - Supports **Visual Encoding** in LTM
    * **Acoustic Encoding** in **LTM** (**Rubin** 1977)
        - Recall **more lyrics**
            * When provided with **meolody** of a well-learned song
            * (e.g Star Spangled Banner
        - Recall **less lyrics**
            * When given **no melody/cue**
        - Evidence of very long-term memory for **songs** 
        - Supports **acoustic encoding in LTM**
- How is **Most Information Encoded**?
    * **Short-Term Memory** (STM)
        - Most info is coded **acoustically**
        - Most **errors** in **retrieval** involve **errors of sound**
    * **Long-Term Memory** (LTM)
        - Most info is coded **semnatically**
        - Most **recital errors** involve **semantic confusion**
        - **False recall** of **items** with **similar meaning**
    * There are **Exceptions** in both cases:
        - Some semantic & visual coding in STM
        - Some visual and acoustic in LTM
            * Consistent with Levels of Processing Model
            * (Craik & Lockhar 1972) LOP
            * **Semantic** is **deper than acoustic**
                - **Acoustic** is **deeper than visual**
        - **Autistic** individuals 
            * **Don't have semantic** coding **advantage**
- **Transfer from STM to LTM**
    * Problems of **decay** and **interference**
        - **Decay**: The passage of time causes us to forget
        - **Interference**: Competing info causes us to forget
    * **Transfer** *depends* on *type of memory*
    * **Nondeclarative** (**Implicit**)
        - **Priming** and **Habituation**
            * *Volatile*
            * *Quickly Decay*
        - **Procedural Memory** and **Conditioning**
            * From repeated **practice** (procedures)
            * Conditioning (responses)
            * **Persist in LTM**
            * e.g. 
                - phobias
                - tying shoes
                - driving
    * **Declarative** (**Explicit**)
        - **Info transfered** through **attention**
            * e.g reading to comprehend
        - **Consolidation**
            * Integrating new information into stored information
            * **Metamemory**
                - Strategies to improve memory involving reflecting on own memory processes
            * **Stress**: 
                - **Disrupt/Distort** consolidation OR 
                - **Enhance** it
            * Consolidation Disruption studied in **amnesiacs**
                - Electroconulsive therapy (ECT) patients (Squire, 1986)
                    * Controlled trauma (ECT)
                    * Known history before amnesia
- **Metamemory**
    * *Knowing what you know*
    * Knowing *how* your *memory works*
    * Being able to **asses your own memory**
    * **Young children lack metamemory skills**
    * Principles to Strengthen Memory
        - **Elaborative Rehersal**
            * Is **better** than **Maintence Rehersal**
        - **Distributed practice**
            * Is **better** than **Mass Practice**
            * **"Spacing Effect"**
        - **Organizing** Informantion 
            * **Enhances Memory**
    * **Spacing Effect Theories**
        - **Multiple Encoding Contexts Theory**
            * *Multiple study sessions*
            * Leads to *multiple types of encoding*
            * Thus, more possibility of *matching during test conditions*
        - **REM Theory** (*Rapid Eye Movement*)
            - **More REM** sessions **following study sessions**
            - The **more consolidation occurs**
    * **Mnemonic Devices** to Aid Memory
        * (S) **Categorical Clustering**
            - Organizing a list by **item categories**
            - **We use spontanously**
            - E.g Grocery lists 
                * baking goods: fruits, dairy, bread, canned goods
                * cleaning: windex, soap, etc.
        * (I) **Interactive Images**
            - **Mental images link otherwise isolated words**
            - E.g: If you have to buy socks apples and scissors
                * Imagine: Cutting with a apir of sciors a sock that has an apple stuffed in it.
        * (I) **Pegword System**
            - **Associate new word** with word on **previously memorized list**
            - Form **interactive image** *between* two **words**
            - E.g
                * Memorized list:
                    - One is bun
                    - Two is shoe
                    - Three is tree
                * To rember to buy socks, apples, and scissors
                    - Imagine: An apple between two buns, a sock stuffed inside a shoe, and a pair of scissors cutting a tree
        * (I) **Method of Loci**
            - Visualize **walking around area** with **landmarks**
            - **Link landmarks** to **items** to remeber
            - E.g
                * Sitting on the table is a pencil with info
                * There is a queen of diamonds on the door, etc.
        * (S) **Acronym**
            - Word or expression where **each letter stands for another word**/concept
            - E.g 
                * USA, IQ, etc.
                - IAM PACK = Interactive Images, Acronys, Method of Loci, Pegwords, Acrostics, Categories, and Keywords
        * (S) **Acrostics**
            - Form **sentence** around **each word you want to remember**
            - E.g To memorize the lines of treble clef:
                * **E**very **G**ood **B**oy **D**oes **F**ine
        * (S) **Keyword Systems**
            - **Link sound & meaning** of **new word** 
                * To **sound & meaning** of **familiar word**
            - E.g
                * Need to know that butter in french is beurre
                * Beurre sounds like "bear"
                * Now associate bear with butter in an image or sentence
                * Maybe now a bear is eating butter
    - Which **Menumonic Device** to Use?
        * Depends on **kind of task** required **at time of retrival**
        * **Roediger** (1980), Compared strategies **based on type of recall**
            - **Free Recall**
                * **Imagry of Isolated Items** >
                    - than **Elaborative Verbal Rehreasal**
            - **Serial Recall**
                * **Elaborative Rehersal** >
                    - than **Imagry of Isolated Items**
            - **Both Types**
                * **Interative Imagry, Loci, Pegword** > 
                    - Elaborative Rehresal or Imagrey of Isolated Items
        * Consider **reitreival of info** when deciding **how to encode to LTM**
- **Prospective vs. Retrospective Memory**
    * **Retrospective**
        - Memory for things **of the past**
    * **Prospective**
        - Memory for things we need to do or remeber **in the future**
        - Ex. Buy bread on way home wfrom word
        - Ex. Study for upcoming exam
        - Ex. Buy birthday card for parent
    * Both **retrospective and prospective** memory **declines with age**
        - **Prospective declines slower** than retrospective
            * Declines show up in lab tests
            * Naturalistic studies: 
                - **Older adults better at prospective than young adults**
            * Reflects **improved metamemory strategies**
- **Retrieval** Processes
    * **Basics**
        - Retrival
            * **Getting information** back **out of memory**
        - Multiple processes can be used to enhance retrieval
        - **Different stragies** used for 
            * Short term storage and Long term storage
        - **Matching** the **type of processes** 
            * Done during **encoding** with 
            * The **type of process** done at **retrieval** 
            * **Increases success**
    * **Retrieval from STM**
        * **Serial** versus **Parallel** Search
            - **Serial**
                * **One-by-One** Item Search of Memory
            - Parallel
                * **All items** are Procesed **At Once*
        * **Exhaustive** versus **Self-Terminating** Search
            - **Exhaustive**
                * **All items** in set examined 
                * (**even after target s found**)
            - **Self-Terminating**
                * Once **target is found**
                * The **Search Stops**
    * **Serial Exhaustive Model Support** (Saul Sternberg 1967)
        - Memorize a set of number symbols
            * e.g 73572
        - 3 Critical factors manipulated
            * How many items (*symbols*) were in set partiapnt had to memorize
            * Whether probe was present in list
            * Probe's location
        - Possible Results:
            * a. **Parallel processing**
                - All items *retrived simulatenously*
                - *Set size doesn't affect response time*
            * b. **Serial processing**
                - Each item *retrieved in order*
                - Compare *one at a time*
                - *Large set takes more time* to go through
            * c. **Exhaustive Serial processing**
                - Even if match is found
                - Keep *searching through remaining items*
                - *Location in set* **has no effect**, 
                - **Effective searches take as long as ineffective ones**
            * d. **Self-Terminating Serial processing**
                - **Stop Searching** after **match is found**
                - **Early items** take **less response time** than later items
        - Result
            * Data fit the **Models B & C**
                - (**Serial Processing** & **Exhaustive Serial Processing**)
            * Repsonse time increased linearly with set size
                - **Regardless of serial position**
        - **Conclusion**
            * **STM Retrival is a serial exhaustive process**
            * Comparing items took 38 ms on average 
                - (some variablity)
            * **Findings were replicated** in another study
        - Controversy
            * **Corcocan (1971)** 
                - Proposed that **parllel model also explains pattern
                - **Horse Race Metaphor**
                    * Adding more horses (items) produces overall longer time to finish a race (retrieve target item) 
                    * Even in horses run simulatanously (parallel)
                    * Larger random sample of horses will result in more variation in running speeds 
                        - (item retrieval speeds).
                    * Race isn't over until slowest horse crosses the line
                    * So slowest horse (longest RT) dicatates overall retrival time
            * **Townsend (1971) **
                - Showed **mathematically impossible** to
                    * **Distinguish parallel from serial exhaustive**
                - Thus, both models still exist
