Chapter 6 - Memory Processes
============================
- **Process**
    * **Encoding**
        - Acquire & transofrm sensory input into representation in memory
    * **Storage**
        - Retain the encoded ifnromation (represenations) in memory
    * **Retrieval**
        - Gain access to information in memory
- Encoding
    * What is Encoding
        - Coding(N): 
            * The way **information is represented in memory**
            * The form in which it is stored
        - Coding(V)
            * Process by which we acquire info
            * Transfer it into a memory
            * e.g from a class lecture
    * Types of Codes
        - Acoustic Auditory Code
            * Based on what the stimulus sounds like
            * E.g the sound of the professors voice & words
        - Semantic Code
            * Based on what the stimulus means
            * E.g Meaning of what the profressor is talking about
        - Visual Code
            * Based on what the stimulus looks like; imagry
            * E.g what the project slide images and text look like
- Encoding Types and STM
    * Type of code may rely on type of task
    * STM refers to memory that is held temporaily
        - Usually 30 sec
- Evidence for Acoustic Encoding in STM
    * Conrad (1964)
        - Visually presented series of letters briefly.
        - Immediatly write the letters viewed once series is complete
        - Most common errors are letters that sounded like targets
        - Usually not visual errors (letters that look like targets)
        - Thus Contrad, concluded that the code for STM is **acoustic/auditory**
        - Another example: Even if we look up a phone number (visual stimulus), we repeat the sound of the numbers in our heads (acoustic rehearsal) to keep them in STM for serial recall
        - But is all STM acoustic?
    * Shulman (1970)
        - Paricipants viewed 10-word lists
        - Given a recognition test (Did yuou see this word?) using **visually** written proble words which were either
            * **Homonyms** -eg. bawl for ball
                - Sounds are smae, but differnt meaning
            * **Synonyms** 0eg. talk for speak
                - Sounds are differnt, but same in meaning
            * **Identical** to the original word -eg. kite and kite
                - Sound and meaning are same ( to create a taks to do)
        - Preidciton: if we encode only acoustically, homonyms (same sounds) would produce more errors than synoyms (diffent sounds)
        - But if we encode semantically, synonyms (same meanings) could also produce errors (even though they sound different)
        - Results:
            * Homonym and Synonym probes produced **similar** error rates
                - Suggests an equal amount of **acoustic and semantic** encoding in STM
- Evidence for **Visual** Encoding in STM
    * Seems at least some memory tasks would require visual codes
        - e.g recall a diagram , a map, a floor plan
    * Posner & Keele 1967:
        - Letter matching task: Two letters seperated by brief interval
        - Participant had to indicate if same latter followed the first
        - Preict differnce in RT between first two trials above
            * If acoustic coding only *no both involve same cousnds)
            * If visual (same sound, just visual)
        - If ltters were the same visually (a-a) partipants were faster than if the letters were not the same visually (A-a)
        - Results indicate that **visual** code was also present for STM
- **Encoding Types** in **Long Term Memory**
    * Types of code may rely on **Type of task**means
    * LTM refers to memory that may be held *permanetly*
    * Semantic Encoding in LTM 
        - Grossman & Eagle 1970
            * Gave participants 41 differnet words to study
            * Given recognitoin test after 5 minute delay
                - Was (word) in the list?
        - Half ot the distractors were **synonyms**
            * 9 words that were semnatically related to words on list
            * e.g word = "bot" distractor = "ship"
        - Half of the distractors were not semantically related
        - Predict a diff in flase alarms for synonym vs. non-synonym distractors if we do code semantically in LTM?
            * Rdesult: False alarm rate for each distrator type:
                - 1.83 synonynms
                - 1.05 of unrelated
            * Support hypothesis for semantic encoding in LTM
        - Another study: Bousfield (1953)
            * Had people learn a list of 60 words with 15 animals, professions, vegtables, and person names mixed in.
            * Use of free recall showed that during recall people naturally clumped their words seially into 4 semantic groups
    * Visual ENcoding in LTM
        - Frost (1972)
            * Participants studied 16 drawings
                - Pictures of clothes, animals, vehicles, furniture
            * Msainuplated visual orientation (same or different) and semantic category
                - Left, right, horizontal, vertical angles
            * After a delay, participants asked if they had studied an object with the same name as the test object
            * Reaction time was measured
            * If visual coding occurs, what would you predict?
                - Faster to identical vs. different orientation
            * Results: Particpants responded faster to identical drawings that drawing in a different orientation
            * Supports hypothesis that visual encoding occured
    * Acoustic Encoding in LTM
        - Evidence of very long-term memory for **songs** 
        - Rubin (1977)
            * Paritipants recall more of the text when provided with the **meolody** of a well-leanred song
            * ("Star SPangled Banner") then when given no cue
- Most Information Encoded how?
    * Short-Term Memory (STM)
        - Most info is coded **acoustically**
            * Most errors in retrieval involve errors of sound
    * Long-Term Memory (LTM)
        - Most info is coded **semnatically**
            * Most reitical errors involve semantic confusion
            * False recall or recognition of items with similar meaning
    * As we've seen, there are expecptions in both cases:
        - Some smenatic & visual coding in STM
        - Some visual and acoustic in LTM
            * Consistent with Levels of Processing Model
                - Ch.5 Craik & Lockhar 1972
            * Semantic is deper than acoustic, which is deeper than visual
                - Intrestting autistic individuals don't show this semantic coding advantage
- Transfer from STM to LTM
    * Problems of decay and interference
    * Transfer depends on type of memory
    * Nondeclarative (implicit)
        - Priming, habituation
            * volatile, quickly decay
        - Procedural memory, Conditioning
            * From repeated **practice** (procedures)
            * Conditioning (responses)
            * Persist in LTM
            * E.g) phobias, tying shoes, driving
    * Declarative (explicit)
        - Info transffered through attention
            * e.g reading to comprehend
        - **Consolidation**: integrating new information into stored information
            * **Metamemory**: strategies to improve memory that involes reflecting on own memory processes
            * **Stress**: can **disrupt/distort** consolidation or **enhance** it
            * Consolidation disruption studied in **amnescias**
                - Electroconulsive therapy (ECT) patients (Squire, 1986):
                    * controlle dtrauma (ECT), known history before amnesia
- Metameory
    * Knowing what you know
    * Knowing howyour memory workds
    * Being able to asses your own memory
    * Young children lack metamemory skills
    * Principles to Strengthen Memory
        - Elaborative rehersal is better than amintence rehersal
        - Distributed practice is better than mass practice
            * "Spacing Effect"
        - Organizing informantion enhances memory
- What Causes the Spacing Effect
    * Multiple Encoding Contexts Theory
        - Multiple study sessions
        - Leads to multiple types of encoding
        - Thus, more possibility of matching during test conditions
    * REM Theory (Rapid Eye Movement)
        - The more REM sessions following study sessions
        - The more consolidation that occurs
- Mnemonic Devices to Aid Memory
    * Sternberg Table 6.1: Most involve organizing by semantics/meaning (S) or by images (I)
    * (S) Categorical Clustering:
        - Organizing a list by item categories
        - We use spontanously
        - E.g Grocery lists (fruits, dairy, bread, canned goods)
    * (I) Interactive Images
        - Mental images link otherwise isolated words
        - 
    * (S) Acrostics
        - Form a sentence around each word you want to remember
    * (S) Keyword Systems
        - Link sound & meaning of new word to sound & meaning of familiar word
            * 
- Which Mnemonic is the best?
    * Depends on kind of task required at time of retrival
        - Roediger (1980)
            * Compared stragies based on type of recall
            * Free recall: imagrey of isolated items > elbaorative verbal rehreasal
            * Serila Recall: elaborative rehersal > imagry of isolated imagerey
            * Both types: Interative imagry, loci, pegword > elaborative rehresal or imagrey of isolated items
    * So considering purpose for reitreiving the info when deciding thow to encode it into LTM
- Prospective cs. Retrospective Memory
    * Retrospective:
        - Memory for things of the past
    * Prospective:
        - Memory for things we need to do or remeber in the future
            * Buy bread on way home wfrom word
            * Study for upcoming exam
    * Both retrospective and prospective memory declines with age
        - Propstive declines slower than retrospective
            * Declines show up in lab tests
            * Naturalistic studies: older adults better than young adults
            * Probally reflects improved metamemory strategies
- More on Retrieval Processes
    * Retrival: Getting information back out of memory
    * Multiple processes can be used to enhance retrieval
    * **Different stragies** are used for short term storage and long term storage
    * **Matching** the typ eof proceses done during **encoding** with the type of 
- Retrival from STM
    * Is the search serial or parallel?
        - Serial: indicates one-by-one item search of memory
        - Parallel means all items are procesed at once
    * Is the search exhaustive or self-terminating?
        - Exhaustive: indicates that all items in the set are examined (even after target s found)
        - Self-Terminating: means that once target is found, the search stops
    * Study: search & Retrieval from STM
        - Saul Sternberg (1967)
        - Memorize a set of number symbols
            * e.g 73572
        - 3 Critical facotrs manipulated
            * How maby items *symbols* were in the set the particpants had to memorize
            * Wherether the probe was present in the list
            * The probe's location
        - Possible Results:
            * a. Parallel processing
                - All items retrived simulatenously
                - Set size doesn't affect response time
            * b. Serial processing
                - Each item rertied in order
                - compare one at a time
                - larget set takes more time ot go through
                    * c. Exhaustive serial processing
                        - Even if match is found
                        - Keep searching through remaining items
                        - Location in set has no effect, effective searches take as long as ineffective ones
                    * d. Self-terminating serial processing
                        - stop searching after match is found
            * data fit the models b & c
                - repsonse time incrased linerally with set size, regardless of serial position
            * sternberg's conclusion: stm retrival is a serial exhaustive process
                - comparing items took 38 ms on average (some variablity)
                - findings were replicated in another study
                - but... corcocan (1971) proposed that a parllel model also explains pattern
                    * horse race metaphore
                        - adding more horses (iutems) produces overall longer time to findish a race (retrieve target item) even in hroses run simulatanously (parallel)
                        - larger random sample of horses will result in more variation in running speeds (item retrieval speeds).
                        - race isn't over until slowest horse crosses the lin
                        - So slowest horse (longest RT) dicatates overall retrival time
                    * townsend (1971) showed its mathematically impossible to distinguish parallel from serial exhaustive
                        - thus, both models still exist
