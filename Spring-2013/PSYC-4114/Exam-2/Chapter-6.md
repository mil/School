Chapter 6 - Memory Processes
============================
- Process
    * Encoding
        - Acquire & transofrm snsoery input into representation in memory
    * Storage
        - Retain the encoded ifnromation (represenations) in memory
    * Retrival
        - Gain access to information in memory
- Coding
    * The forms in which we encode
    * Coding(n): The way informaiton is represented in memory; the form in which it is stored
        - Vs. Coding(v) = process by which we acquire info & transofrm it into a memory
            * e.g from a class lecture
    * Acoustic auditory) code
        - Based on what the stimulus sounds like
            * E.g the sound of the professors voice & words
    * Semantic Code
        - Based on what the stimulus means
    * Visual Code
- Encoding Types and STM
    * Type of code may rely on type of task
    * STM refers to memory that is held temporaily
        - Usually 30 sec
- Evidence for Acoustic Encoding in STM
    * Conrad (1964)
        - Visually presented series of letters briefly.
        - Immediatly write the letters viewed once series is complete
        - Most common errors are letters that sounded like targets
        - Usually not visual errors (letters that look like targets)
        - Thus Contrad, concluded that the code for STM is **acoustic/auditory**
        - Another example: Even if we look up a phone number (visual stimulus), we repeat the sound of the numbers in our heads (acoustic rehearsal) to keep them in STM for serial recall
        - But is all STM acoustic?
    * Shulman (1970)
        - Paricipants viewed 10-word lists
        - Given a recognition test (Did yuou see this word?) using **visually** written proble words which were either
            * **Homonyms** -eg. bawl for ball
                - Sounds are smae, but differnt meaning
            * **Synonyms** 0eg. talk for speak
                - Sounds are differnt, but same in meaning
            * **Identical** to the original word -eg. kite and kite
                - Sound and meaning are same ( to create a taks to do)
        - Preidciton: if we encode only acoustically, homonyms (same sounds) would produce more errors than synoyms (diffent sounds)
        - But if we encode semantically, synonyms (same meanings) could also produce errors (even though they sound different)
        - Results:
            * Homonym and Synonym probes produced **similar** error rates
                - Suggests an equal amount of **acoustic and semantic** encoding in STM
- Evidence for **Visual** Encoding in STM
    * Seems at least some memory tasks would require visual codes
        - e.g recall a diagram , a map, a floor plan
    * Posner & Keele 1967:
        - Letter matching task: Two letters seperated by brief interval
        - Participant had to indicate if same latter followed the first
        - Preict differnce in RT between first two trials above
            * If acoustic coding only *no both involve same cousnds)
            * If visual (same sound, just visual)
        - If ltters were the same visually (a-a) partipants were faster than if the letters were not the same visually (A-a)
        - Results indicate that **visual** code was also present for STM
