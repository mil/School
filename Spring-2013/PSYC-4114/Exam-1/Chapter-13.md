Chapter 13 - Intelligence
=========================
- **Cognition and Intelligence**
    * **Intelligence**: An _integrating_ ("umbrella") psychological construct
        - Ties together much research in cogntivie psychologive
    * **Involves**:
        - The **capacity to learn from experience**
            * (_using metacognitive processes to enhance learning_)
        - The ability to **adapt to the surrounding enviroment**
    * **Psychometric Approach to Intelligence**
        - IQ Tests: Intelligence Qutota
            * Mental Age dvivded by Chronological Age
        - Weschler: WASI, WISC, WAIS
        - Standord Binet
- **Cognitive Models of Intelligence**
    * **Hierarchial Models**
        - **Fluid Ability**: Speed and accuracy of abstract rasoning
        - **Crystalized Ability**: Acummulated knowledge and vocabulatry
    * **Three Stratum Model of Inelligence** (A hierarchy type)
        - "Cattell-Horn-Carroll Theory"
        - Hierarchy of Cognitive Abilities within 3 Strata
            * **Stratum I**: _Specific_ Abilities (e.g Spelling ability)
            * **Stratum II**: _Broad_ Abilities (e.g fluid and crystallized intelligence)
            * **Stratum III**: _Generalized_ Intelligence ("g")
        - **Fluid Intelligence** = Speed & Accuracy of abstract reasoning, novel problem solving
        - **Crystallized Intelligence** = Accumulated knowledge & vocuabulary
        - Also: Quant reasoning, Reading/writing ability, storage/retriveal/ visual & auditory processing, 
            * ,Processing speed, decision/ reacion time
    * **Theory of Multiple Intelligences**
        - Dvised by Gardner
        - Claims **8 distinct**, **independent intelligences**
        - **Modular** but can **interact**
            * Linguistic
            * Logical-mathematical
            * Spatial
            * Musical
            * Body-Kinesthic
            * Interpersonal
            * Intrapersonal
            * Naturalist
        - IQ Tests address only linguistic , logic, and spacial aspects
        - Evidence: Exceptional individual, lesions destroy 1 type, 
            * Core operatoins for each type (vs. factor analysis of psychometric tests)
        - Not well-established; _untested_, may be unfalsifiable
    * **Triarchic (3) Theory of Intelligence**
        - Developed by **Sternberg**
        - Intelligence constsis of **creative, analytical, and pratical** abilities
