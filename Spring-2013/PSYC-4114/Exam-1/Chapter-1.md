Chapter 1 - Introduction to Cognitive Psychology
================================================
- **What is Cognitive Psychologists?**
    * Study of how People
        - **Percieve** , **Learn**, **Remember**
        - **Think** about **Information**
    * Involves a Variety of **Mental Processes**
        - Memory, Attention, Language, Problem Solving
        - Decision Making, Reading
    * **Cognition**: People Think
    * **Cognitive Psychology**: Scientists think about how people think
- **Dialectic Progression** of Ideas
    * **Thesis**
        - **Statement** of **Opinion** or **Belief**
        - e.g: "Biology determines human nature" (_Early 20th Century_ View)
    * **Antithesis** (Anti-thesis)
        - **Counterstatement**: **counters** a previous statement of belief
        - e.g: "The enviroment determines human nature" (_1960s_ View)
    * **Synthesis**
        - **Integrates** most **Credible Features** of **Thesis and Antithesis**
            * (Best of Both Views)
        - e.g: "Nature and nurture _interact_ to determine human nature" (_Modern View_)
- **Roots of (Cognitive) Psychology**
    * A _teacher_ and his _student_ **disagree**...
    * **Rationalism** (Plato)
        - _Logic & Reasoning_ is Key to knowledge/truth
        - **Philosophy**: Introspection and reasoning
        - **Descartes**
            * Cogito, ergo sum
            * Senses can decieve. 
            * Knowledge comes from Reason & Math
    * **Empiricism** (Aristotle)
        - _Experience & Observation_ is Key
        - **Physiology**: Emperical study of body functions
        - **Locke**
            * Knowledge comes from sensory experience (evidence)
            * "Tabula Rosa" -- Blank Slate
    * **Synthesis** is called: **Transcendental Idealism**
        - **Kant**'s modern view
        - Reason without experience is empty, devoid of any content
            * And yet experience without reason and thought is blind
        - **Both experience & reason have a role**
- **Other Roots of (Cognitive) Psychology**
    * **Strucuralism**
        - **Wundt & Tichener**
        - "Elements" or _Structures_ of the mind
        - 1st Major School of Thought in Psychology
        - Classify structures (Content) of the mind (sesnsations, thoughts)
        - Seeks to understand how the _structures interact_
        - **Introspection**
            * Looking inward at pieces of informatin passing through consciousnes
            * **Think aloud**, _Empericist Methodology_
    * **Functionalism**
        - **James & Dewey**
        - "Process" of what things do (vs. content/structure of mind)
        - What we do with the mind, how, and why
        - Naturally lead to **Pragmatism**
        - But didn't specify how learning happens
    * **Synthesis** is called: **Associationism**
        - Emphasizes how events/ideas become **associated** _with one another_ 
            * Within the mind via **learning**
        - **Aristotle**
            * **Contiguity**: Relating events/things **close in time**
            * **Similarity**: Relating things of **similar features**
            * Contract (polarity, e.g hot/cold, day/night)
        - **Ebbinghaus**
            * Use _Self-Observation_
                - Memory for nonsense syllables, RT & errors
            * Study of Learning by **Rehersal**
                - Concious repetition of material
        - **Thorndike**
            * Termed **Law of Effect**
                - Stimulus tend to produce **certain response** over time if organism **rewarded**
                - We learn "effects" (volunrary responses)
                - via "satifsfactions" (rewards)
                - (e.g. soling math problems for treats)
- From **Association** to _==>_ **Behaviorism**
    * **Associationism**
        - (Thorndike)
        - **Satisfaction/Law of Effect**
    * **Behaviorism**
        - (Pavlov) "Contingency"
            * Dog salivates at sight of lab assistant
            * Dog trained to salivate at the sound of a bell
        - _Extremist Associatism_ (enviroment has direct ties to behavior)
        - Make presence of food (US) contigent on presence of bell (CS) -> CR
        - **Classical Conditiong** - _Involuntary learning_
        - Contiguit (temporal) + contigency (US with CS)
    * **Synthesis** is called: **Radical Behaviorism**
        - We can only _observe_ and thus study the enviroment (input)
        - Behavior is the output
        - Non unobservable mental processes (**mind = the black box**)
        - **Watson**: 
            * The **Father** of **Radical Behaviorism**
            * "Give me 12 Infants", Little Albert
        - **Skinner**:
            * **Operant Conditioning**: 
                - Strenghting/Weaking of Behavior contigent on rewards/punishment
            * All behavior, **Not just Learning** can be conditioned
- Peeking **Into the Black Box**
    * **Tolman**: All **behavior directed toward** some **goal**
        - Rat in maze try to find food
        - Tolman considered forefather of Modern Cognitive Psychology
    * **Bandura**
        - Learning not from mere direct rewards for some behavior
    * **Gestalt Psychology**
        - Psychological phenomena best explained seen as **structured wholes**
        - Must break things down into smaller parts
        - The **whole differs** from the **sum of its parts**
- **Emergence** of **Cognitive Psychology**
    * Karl **Lashley**: Brain is **active dynamic organizer** of behavior
        - Former student of Behaviorist, Watson
        - **Rejected that brain was a pasive organ** responding to enviroment
    * Donald **Hebb**: Cell assembles are coordinated neural structures
        - Develop **neurons firing** through **frequent stimulation**
        - Behaviorists largely disagreed x
    * Noam **Chomsky**: Insulted Skinner's operant conditioning
        - Infinite number of sentenced produced with ease
        - Understanding of language constrained by innate language aquistition device
        - **Structure of Mind**, rather than enviroment, that guides language acquisition
    * Alan **Turing**: Turning test -- can distinguish human from computers
        - Beginings of **Artifical Intellignece**
    * George **Miller**: The magic number 7 for chunking
        - Introduced **Channel Capacity**: Upper limit can respond to information
    * Jerry **Fodor**: Popularized concept of modularity of the mind
        - **Modularity** implies process in one domain.
        - Some processes, such as intelligence draw on many parts of the mind
- **Research Methods** in Cognitive Psychology
    * **Experimental Studies**
        - Random Sample of participants
        - Manipulate the **Independent** variable (**IV**)
            * Create **Experiemntal** group
            * Create **Control** group
        - **Randomly assign** participants
            * Measure the **dependent** variable (DV)
            * Control all other variables
        - **Typical Dependent Varibales**
            * **Reaction Time** (milliseconds)
                - Mental events take time
            * **Accuracy/Error** Analysis
                - How well the participant does on a task
            * What trade off occurs between these variables?
                - What happens to your error rate if you go too fast?
    * **Correlational Studies**
        * Measure 2 (or more) variables of interest and **calculate correlation**.
            - Does X relate to Y? If so, _how_?
                * Most common: Pearson Product-Moment r (actually developed by Francis Galton)
                    - Example: x = test anxiety, y = text scores (exam performance)
        * **Direction of Relationship**: **sign** of "r"
            - What does positive vs. negative look like?
        * Strength of (Linear) Relationship: **Size** of "r"
            - What does strong vs. weak look like?
            - Meaning if **signifigant** (p < .05)?
        * **Limitation**: Correlation does not imply causation!
        * **Casual Directionality**: Does Delta X lead to Delta Y, or Delta Y to Delta X?
            - There is no IV and DV
        * **Third Variable Problem** & Spurious Correlation
            - **Confound**: Unmeasured variable affects rxv
                * E.g Z = time spent revising answers
                * Z may increase test scores & lower anxiety
                * Controlling for Z may drop rxv to zero
                * e.g Ice cream sales & public pool drownings
        * So why not do _only_ experiments?
            * **Pros**: control confounds, **internal validity** (casual inference)
            * **Cons**: Feasibility, ethics, **ecological validity**
                - Relecance of findings in different enviromental contexts
        * Example of a Correlational Cognitive Study
            - Relationship between **confidence** and **acuracy** of eyewitness in identifying perpetrators
    - **Confidence vs. Knowledge**
        * How well do you know what you know (or don't know)?
        * Does this level of confidence predict accuracy?
            - "I attended every lecture, read the chapters several times, and thought I did pretty well on the exam but..."
        * Familiarity/Understanding vs. Knowing
            - Comprehension vs. Production
        * Students who do well are beter at:
            - Knowing what they know (and don't know)
            - Mastering what they don't know
        * How to get there:
            - **Distributed vs. massed practice**
            - **Test yourself along the way**
                * **Gnerating** vs **reviewing**
            - **Seek critical feedback**
    - **Psychobiological Studies**
        * Investigate **relationship** between **cognitive performance** and **cerebral events/structures**
        * **Postmortem studies**
            - Examine the cortex of deceased people who experienced reading disability
        * **Brain-damed** individuals and their deficits
        * Monitor **brain physiology** participants doing a cognitive task
    - **Self Report Studies**
        * **Verbal Protocol**
            - Participants describe their consious thorughts while solving a story problem
        * **Diary Study**
            - Participants record thoughts
            - _Disadvantage_: Record/actual thought _divergence_
    - **Naturalistic Observation**
        * Detailed study of congition in everyday (non-laboratory) situations
        * Useful for hypothesis formulation (vs. testing)
            - Monitor decision making of pilots during flights
    - **Case Studies**
        * Intensive Studies of Individuals
            - May examine archival record, inteviews, direct observation, or participant-observation
                * **Craetivity of successful individuals**
                * **The deficits of a neglected child**
                * **The most famous cognitive case study?**
                    - H.M (Henry Gustav Molaison)
                    - Age 27: Bilateral lobectomy for severe seizures. Hippocampus damaged -- anterograde amnesia
                    - Studied 55 Years! Died in 2008.
    - **Computers & Cognitive Research**
        * Computers as analogy for _human_ cognition
            - The _sequence_ of _symbol manipulation_ that unerlies **thinking**
            - **Goal**: Discovery of the programs in *human* memory * other mental processes
        * Computer simulations of **Artificial Intelligence**
            - Recreate _human mental processes_ using computers
                * **Eg manipulate objects in 3D space; pattern recognition
- **Recap**: Some **Underlying Themes**
    * **Nature vs. Nurture**
        - Genes/Biology and enviroment influence cognition
    * **Rationalist vs. Empiricism**
        - Logical resasoning/theory and observation/experience/testing
    * **Structure vs. Processes**
        - Elements/content of mind and how they operate
    * **Domain Generality vs. Domain Specificity**
        - Processes relevant to **multiple domains** (e.g intellegence) 
        - vs. Fodor's **"modularity"** of mind (seperatre linguistic vs. perceptual processes)
    * **Causal Inferences vs. Ecological Validity**
        - Internal Validity of Experiemnts 
        - vs. Ecological validity of case studies & naturalistic obs (see Table 1.1 Text)
    * **Applied vs. Basic Research**
        - **Basic**: Goal is discovery; to understand, satify curisity, expand our knowledge
            * Although.. Basic reaearch often leads to important applications
            * But often there's no forseeable praticual use when conducted
        - **Applied**: Goal is pragmatic; to create, invent, solve a pratical problem
            * Often contirbutes to a more **basic** understandinf of cognition
            *  Priming is explained by spreading activation in memory (basic)
                - Also expalins why skilled readers may read faster (application)
    * **Biological vs. Behavioral Methodology**
- **Key Ideas in Cognitive Psychology**
    * Data can only be fully _explained with theories_
    * And theories are insufficient without data, thus creating the cycle
    * **Cognition is typically adaptive**
        - But erroes humans regularly make can be informative
        - Example: **Spoonerisms**
            * A "lack of pies" ( A pack of lies)
            * Its "roaring with pain" (Its pouring with rain)
            * Systematic (non-random)
                - Hmm. what might this usggest about cognition of language and speech production?"
    * Cognitive processes **interact** with each other and with non-cognitive processes
        - Emotions may affect decisions
        - You learn better when you're motivated to learn
        - Working memory capacity contributes to reading speed
        - Brain Biology affects Cognitiion
        - Cognition (e.g learning) affects brain biology
