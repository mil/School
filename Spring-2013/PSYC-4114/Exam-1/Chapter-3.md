Chapter 3 -- Perception
=======================
* **Definition**:
    - Complex process of **recognizing, organizing, and interpreting sensory** info
    - And how we attach meaning to it
* **Modalities**:
    - Examples:
        - Visual (sight)
        - Auditory (hearing)
        - Olfactory (smell)
        - Haptic (touch)
        - Gustatory (taste)
    - **Distal Object**: The **Actual Stimulus** in **External World**
    - **Informaiton Medium**: _Energy Pattern_ **Imposed by Stimulus**
        * _Reflected Light_, _Sound Waves_
        * _Chemical Molecules_, _Mechinal Pressure_, _Vibration_
    - **Proximal Stimulation**: 
        * (_Of Sensory Rectors_ **by Info Medium**)
        * What you sense (sensation) is not same as what you percieve
        * E.G: Photon Absorption on Retina Rods and Cones
            - Proximal stimulus is the retinal image
            - Only 2-dimensional
                * Also upside down, left-right reverse, and changes with movement...
                * Not what we percieve
    - **Percept**: Meaningful _Interpretation_ of Proximal Stimulus
        * The Mental Representation
        * What we **actually "see", "hear", "taste", "smell", "feel"**
        * Influenced by prior knowledge
        * We percieve a distal object as _constant_, _despite changing proximal stimulation_
            - Based on expecation of invariant relations among objects in the enviroment
    - (Table 3.1)
* **Visual Perception**
    - **Light energy** (photons) enters the eye
    - Passes through the 
        * **Cornea** 
            - **Clear Dome** that Protects the Eye
            - _Protects_ and **Refracts Light**
        * **Pupil** 
            - Hole / opening in **Center of Iris**
            - **Dilation** controlled by **Iris**
    * **Lens** 
        - _Focuses Light Waves_ further
        - **Refracting**: **Bending** the light waves
        - **Inverting**: **Flipping** the light waves 
    * Light waves project onto the **Retina** Receptor Cells 
        - (modified neurons; cones & rods)
        - Receptors **transduce** (convert) light energy to _electrical_ energy 
        - _Electrical Energy_ is **used by nervous system** to **represent external enviroment**
    * Info transmitted along the **optic nerve** to the brain
        - Info crosses at the **Optic Chiasm** based on **Field** of view
        - **Contralateral**: 
            * Left half of each eye's field sent to Right hem.
            * Right half of eye's field sent to Left hemisphere
    * **Optic tract** 
        - Caries info to **lateral  geniculate nucleus** (in thalamus) 
    * The **Lateral Geniculate Nucleus** 
        - Sends the info to the massive (highly innervated) **primary visual cortex** 
            * (in the occipital lobe)
* **Peception** 
    - (From _Sensation_ to _Perception_)
    - Various **features** of stimulus are **extracted to facilitate object recognition**:
        * Ex. Location
        * Ex. Shape, Texture, Size
    - Questions:
        * So where does _sensation_ and perception begin?
        * How much info do we _recieve_ directly from stimuli?
        * How much do we _infer_ from past knowledge?
* **Sensation**:
    - Focuses on the _inital encoding_ of _stimulus qualities_ 
        - (Form, Pattern, Movement) before a percept is _formed_.
        - This first stage of perception, vs. later organziging, interpreating, recongizing, and understanding
            * Is that red thing an apple?
            * Did I just hear a tree fall?
    - What we perceive isn't the same as what we sense
        * And visa-versa
* **Sensory Adaptation**
    - When _sensory receptors_ change their _sensitivity_ to a stimulus based on changes in stimulus intensity
    - **Vision**: 
        * Dimming lights 
            - Pupils Dilate 
            - Iris Muscles Relax Immediatly
            - Photon-Sensitive Chemicals in cone & rod receptors increase (20 minutes)
    - **Hearing**
        * Loud sound 
            - Inner ear bone muscles contracts
            - Reduce Vibrations
    - **Touch**
        * Adapt to hot/cold, pressure, vibration.... 
        * But not pain (nociceptive stim)
    - **Smell/Taste**
        * Cease to detect unless molecule concentration changes
        * Smokers can't smell smoke in the air on their clothes... unless they quit.
    - Sesnory Adaptation allows us to respond to changing/novel (vs. constant/familiar) stimuli
        * When stimulus becomes constant, receptors stop responding to it
            - True for vision too? (Why do I still see Dr.White when he stands still?)
            - Microsaccades (constant tiny eye movements you don't notice)
    - Not **habituation** (attention process)! 
        * **Sensory adaptation** is:  _physiologically_ regulated, at the _sense organ_ level
            - Receptor cells themsleves become less responsive to a constant stimuli
            * Cannot overcome by increasing or descreasing attention
            * Based on changes in stimulus _intensity_
                - not length, number, or recency of prior stimulus exposure
* **Perceptual Illusions**
    - One approach to studying perception process
    - Some illusions cause you to perceive what is _not there_
        * So what we sense (physical qualities reaching) are not necessarily what we percieve
* **Perceptual Constancy**
    - Object percepts remains the same even though our sensation of the object changes
    - Example:
    - **Shape Constancy**: 
        - Percept maintains same shape, despite change sin shape of proximal stimulus 
    - **Size Constantcy**
    - **Ponzo Illusion**: 
        * Equivalent image sizes at different depths
        * Distally_converging lines_ are percieved as _depth_
    - **Equivalent size with depth** normally means **different-sized** objects (in **real world**)
* **Depth Perception**
    - The ability to see the world in 3 dimensions and detect distance
        * **Vision only has a 2-dimensional** view (promal stimulus on retina)
        * We must interpret the information given to _perceive_ depth
* **Monocular** Depth Cues
    - **Texture Gradients**: Grain of item 
    - **Relative Size**: Bigger is closer 
    - **Interposition**: Closer are in front of other object
    - **Linear Perspective**: Parallel lines converge in distance
    - **Aerial Perspetive**: Images seem blurry, the farther away they are
    - **Motion Parallax**: Objects get smaller at decreasing speed in distance
    - M.C Escher's Waterfall -- Monocular
    - Carlo Crivelli -- Annunciation
* **Binocular** Depth Cues
    - **Binocular Convergence**: 
        * Eyes turn inward as object moves towards you
        * Brain uses information to judge distance
    - **Binocular Disparity**:
        * Each eye views a slightly different angle of an object
        * Brain uses this to create a 3-d image
* **Object Perception**
    - **Viewer-Centered Representation**
        * We store in memory visual representation of objects base don how we see them.
        * Multiple views of each object dpending on wher eyou vs. object are located/positioned.
        * Image is viewpoint dependent, 2D template
    - **Object-Cenetered Rperesentation**
        * Object is stored in a way that best represnts it, regardless of how it is viewed.
            - Locations of parts of object are speicfied relative to each other
        * Image is viewpoint invariant, 3D structure
* **Inversion Effects**
    - Faces are hard to recognized when inverted
        * Suggest viewpoint matters for face recognition
* **Object Percption**
    - Evidence support _both_ **viewer** & **object centered** perception
    - How to reconcile?
        * Maybe two ends of a contiuum that both contirbute to object reocngntion
        * **Burgunt & Tarr**: Under what circumstances do we use each process?
    - May depend on which representation is more **efficeint**
        * How about the **Earth** part of a globe
            - Just one 2d circle can represent the basic shape, accross any viewpoint
            - Same for a tomato
        * What about the base & handle parts of globe?
        * Onw object-centered 3d structure may be more efficeint
        * Same for specifric land masse on the globe or a horse
* **Landmark-Centered Orientation**
    - Information is coded by its relation to a well known or prominent item
    - Consider your college campus
        * What a promitemtn item you use to orient yourself on campus -- drillfield, burrus, torg
    - We can switch between these 3 representational strategies
        *  fMRI shows differnt frames of reference involve different brain areas
* **Gestalt View of Perception**
    - **Gestalt Psychology**: 1800s-1940s
        * Belin School: Kurt Koffka, Wlfgang Kohler, Max Wertheimer
    - Perception _doesn't just_ **maintain size** and **shape constancy** in depth
    - Also **organizes** objects in visual array into **groups**
    - **Basic Gestalt Tenant**
        * "The whole is more than the sum of its parts"
           - Koffka acutally said the whole is "other" than the sum of its parts
    - **Law of Pragnanz**
        * Explains how we percetually group objects (or parts of objects) to form integral wholes
        * Individuals **organize** their experieince to be:
            - **Simple**,  **Concise**, **Symetrical**, and **Complete** 
    - **Gestalt Rules of Visual Perception**
        * **Figure-Ground**
            - Organize perceptions by **distinguishing between a figure and a background**
        * **Proximity**
            - Elements tends to be **grouped together according to their _nearness_**
        * **Similarity**
            - Items **similar** in some respect tend ot be **grouped together**
        * **Continuity**
            - Based on **smooth continuity** which is pereffered to absrupt changes of direction
        * **Closure**
            - Items grouped together if they tend to **complete a figure**
        * **Symmetry**
            - Prefer to percieve objects as **mirror images**
            - Regions bounded by symmetrical bordered percieved as coherent figure
            - Ex. See 2 overlapping diamons vs. 1 small diamond  and two irregular objects
* **Pattern Recognition** Systems
    - How do we recognize patterns (eg. face, flower)?
    - Farah(1992) proposed two systems:
        * (Opposes Gestalt View)
        * **First System**
            - Recognize **parts**, elements
            - Assemeble into wholes
            - Less-Familiar Face Recognition
        * **Second System**
            - See **wholes**, configurations, form
            - Then analyze parts
            - Familar face recognition
                * Overlook minor changes
    - _Evidence_ for **Second System**
        * Face Recogintion and Object Recongiton use different Systems
        * These systems show functional indepnednece (Farah 200)
        * Face Rcognition is different
            - Uses Fufisform Gruyrs
    - _Functional Independence_ Evidence
        * **Prosopagnosia**
            - **Inability** to **Recognize Faces** after brain damage
            - Even close friends, family, somestimes own face
            - Identify others through other features
                * Voice, Gait, Contex, Unique Facial Features
            - Ability to Recongize Other objects is intact
        * **Associative Agnosia**
            - **Difficulty** with **Recognizing Objects**
            - Can draw(copy) them
                * Percieve, but cannot indentify or name
            - Can recognize faces
    - "Special" **Nature of Facial Recognition** [Tanka & Farah (1993)]
        * Faces and names
        * Pictures of homes and home owner's names
        * Test given -- pieces of home/piece of face shown
        * Recall names of homes/faces
        * _Found_: People have **more difficulty** recognizing **parts of faces** than **parts of houses**
    - **Fusiform Gyrus** in _Temporal Lobe_
        * Implicated in **Pattern Recognition**
        * More active in Face Recognition _compared to_ other Common Objects
        * Face Specificty? Or are we just face experts?
        * Could be used in more _general_ pattern recognition (we are experts)
            - Ex. Recognize birds, cards, chess, lepidoptera
            - **Expert Individuation Hypothesis**
                * **Expertise in visually discriminating** any class of objects is **faciliated** by _fusiform gyrus_
* **Theories of Perception**
    - **Direct** _Perception_ Theories (_Bottom-Up_)
        * **Basics**
            - Perception _comes from the stimuli_ in the enviroment
            - **Bottom-up**: ("_Data-Driven_") Processing
            - Process:
                * Parts of stimulis identified
                * Put together to form a percept
                * Then recognition occurs
            - Ex. See edges, rectangular, and other shpaes, lighed regions.. put together info to conclusde your seeing doors & hallway
        * **Gibson's Ecological Model**
            - Sensory Experience --> Perception (No Complex Thought in between)
            - All info need to form perception is available in our info-rich enviroment
                * (Stimuli & Contex)
                * Complex Time & Space Info: A "Transforming Optical Array"
                * Thus, _perception guides action_
                * Which consequently _creates new perceptual input_
                    - (not just static snapshots)
            - **Perception** is **immediate** and **sponatneous**
                * We simply **detect** stimuli
                * Full perceptual abilites present at birth
                * Biologicall tuned to respond
                * **No** top-down processing (e.g memory/reflection on prior experience)
            - An "**Ecological Model**"
                * Perception = how human (animal) knows its enviroment
                * **Niche**: Person and Enviroment are inseperable (must consider together)
        * **Template Thoeries**
            - **Template** = Highly detailed model in memory for every pattern we might recognize
            - Templates are **Holistic**
                * Unalyzed entities like "cutouts"
                * Multiple templates held in long-term memory
            - Process for Recognizing Incoming Stimuli:
                * Compare percept to templates in memory until exact match is found
                * Find an exact match to template
            - In Everday Life:
                * Check Sorter Machines, Fingerprint Matching, UPC Bar Codes, Chess Players
                * **Sensory Store** Memory (iconic store) might work this way
            - **Weaknesses**:
                * Problem of **Imperfect Matches**
                * Requires impossibly large memory store of templates
                    - All possible position, orientation, and size variants
                * Cannot acount for **flexibility** of pattern recognition system
                    - (recongizing different handwriting styles)
        * **Prototype Theories**
            - More _flexible_ than template matching
            - **Prototype** = Average of a class of related objects or patterns
                * Includes most typical (frequently observed) features
                * Various instances of object abstracted common charactersitic to **prototype**
                * Highly Represntative **Idealization**
                    - Not perfect match, only approximate
                * No one feature required
                * More features --> greater probaliity of a match
            - **Evidence**
                * Franks & Bransford
                    - Presented objects based on prototyupes
                    - Never saw prototype
                    - Particpants congident they saw prototype
                * Solso & McCarthy (1981)
                    - Particpants shown a seris of face drawings
                    - Prototypes recognized
                    - Direct relation between confidence / prototype
                * More Research
                    - Prototypical faces are found to be **more attractive**
                    - Protypical buety
        * **Feature Theories** (Distinctive features)
            - Recognizes objects on basis of **small number of characteristics** (features)
            - **Pandemonium Model** (Selfridge)
                * **Image Demons**: Recieve snsory input (e.g the letter "R") and pass onto retinal image
                * **Feature Demons**: Decode specific features (vertical lines, horizonal lines, angles, curves, etc). and call out matches between stimulus and given feature...
                * **Cognitive Demons**: Shouw when patterns in memory match features
                * **Decision Demon**: 
                    - Listens to pandemonium of cognitive demons
                    - Decides which cognitive demons shouts the most
            - **Hubel & Wiesel**
                * **Simple Cells** detect bars/edges of particular orientation in particular location
                * **Complex Cells** detect bars/edges of particular orientation
                * **Hypercomplex Cells** detect particular colors
                    - (simple and complex cells), bars, edges, etc in particular direction
            - **Navon** (1977)
                * **Local features**: Components / Details
                * **Global Features**: Overall shape
                * **Global Precendence**: 
                    - For **close-together** global features are identified faster than local features
                    - Can interfere w/ local feature recognition
                * **Local Precendence**
                    - For **far-apart** local features, local features idnetified feaster than global features
                    - Can interfere w/ global feature recognition
            - **Feature Theory** _Challenges_
                * Theory must specify **how* the features are **combined/joined**
                * These models deal most easily w/ fairly **simple stimuli**

            - **Structural-Desciprtion** Theory
                * **Biederman** (1987):
                * Form stable 3D mental representation of objects based on a few viewpoints 
                * Indepndent geometrical shapes = "**geons**"
                * **Recongition by Components** (RBC) Theory: observe stimulus and decompose into **geons**
                * Explains ability to quikly recognize even degrated stimuli as instance of a general class
                    - (Its a chair, cup face)
                * Doesn't account for recongition or distinction of parituclar objects (or own face)
                * Evidence -- Biederman & Cooper (1991):
                    - Used visual priming to demonstate the existence of geons in a picture naming task
                    - Subjects shown series of fragmented pictures and were asked to identfy the objects
                    - Objects broken into geons, etc.
                * Adavantages:
                    - Recognize important of arragment of parts
                    - Parsimonous: Small set of primitve shapes (geons
                * Weaknesses:
                    - Structure not always key to recognition
                    - Which geons? (simplicity vs explantory adequency)
            - **Disadvantages**
                * Not every isntance of pattern has **all** the features
                    - Though see **protoype theories**
                * Does not take into account how the features are put together
                    - Though see **structure description** theories
    - **Constructive** _Perception_ Theories
        * People acitvly construct perceptions using information based on excpetations
        * **Top-down**: ("_Theory-Driven_") Processing
        * Process:
            - Expectations, Theories or Concepts Exist
            - These Theories/Concepts combine info into Reocnizing Patterns
        * Active Percept Construction
