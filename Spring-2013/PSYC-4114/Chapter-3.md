Chapter 3 -- Perception
=======================
* **Definition**:
    - Complex process of recognizing, organizing, and interpreting sensory info
    - And how we attach meaning to it
* **Modalities**:
    - Examples:
        - Visual(sight)
        - Auditory(hearing)
        - Olfactory(smell)
        - Haptic(touch)
        - Gustatory(taste)
    - **Distal Object**: The actual stimulus in external World
    - **Informaiton Medium**: Energy pattern imposed by stimulus
        * Reflecte dlight, sound waves, chemical molecules, mechinal pressure, vibration
    - **Proximal Stimulation**: Of sensory rectors by info medium.:
        * What you sense (sensation) is not same as what you percieve
        * e.g: photon absorption on retina rods and cones
            - Proximal stimulus is the retinal image
            - Only 2-dimensional
                * Also upside down, left-right reverse, and changes with movement...
                    - not what we percieve
    - **Percept**: Meaningful interpretation of proximal stimulus
        * The mental representation
        * What we actually "see", "hear", "taste", "smell", "feel"
        * Influenced by prior knowledge
        * We percieve a distal object as _constant_, desptire changing proximal stimulation
            - Based on expecation of invariant relations among objects in the enviroment
    - (Table 3.1)
* **Visual Perception**
    - Light energy (photons) enters the eye
    - Passes through the 
        * **Cornea** (protects, refracts light)
        * **Pupil** (hole; dilation controlled by **iris**
    * **Lens** focuses light waves further, refracting (bending) & _inverting_ (flipping) them
    * Light waves project onto the **retina** receptor cells (modified neurons; cones & rods)
        - Receptors transduce (convert) light energy to _electrical_ enegry used by nervous system to represent external enviroment
    * Info transmitted along the **optic nerve** to the brain, crossing at the **optic chiasm** based on **field** of view
        - (**contralateral**: L half of each eye's field sent to R hem. , R. half sent to L. hem)
    * **Optic tract** caries info to **lateral  geniculate nucleus** (in thalamus) 
    * The **Lateral Geniculate Nucleus** sends the info to the massive (highly innervated) **primary visual cortex** (in the occipital lobe)
* **Peception** from _Sensation_ to _Perception_
    - Various features of stimulus are extracted to facilitate object recognition:
        * e.g location, shape texture, size
    - So where does _sensation_ and perception begin?
    - How much info do we _recieve_ directly from stimuli?
    - How much do we _infer_ from past knowledge?
    - **Sensation**:
        * Focuses on the _inital encoding_ of _stimulus qualities_ (form, pattern, movement) before a percept is _formed_.
        * This first stage of perception, vs. later organziging, interpreating, recongizing, and understanding
            - Is that red thing an apple? (
            - Did I just hear a tree fall?
    - What we perceive isn't the same as what we sense
        * And visa-versa
* **Sensory Adaptation**
    - When _sensory receptors_ change their _sensitivity_ to a stimulus based on changes in stimulus intensity
    - **Vision**: Dimming lights; pupils dilate (iris muscles relax; immediate)
        * Photon-sensitive chemicals in cone & rod receptors increase (20 minutes)
    - **Hearing**: Loud sound; inner ear bone muscles contracts, reduce vibrations
    - **Touch**: Adapt to hot/cold, pressure, vibration.... but not pain (nociceptive stim)
    - **Smell/Taste**: Cease to detect unless molecule concentration changes
        * Smokers can't smell smoke in the air on their clothes... unless they quit.
    - Allows us to respond to changing/novel (vs. constant/familiar) stimuli
        * When stimulus becomes constant, receptors stop responding to it
            - True for vision too? (Why do I still see Dr.White when he stands still?)
            - Microsaccades (constant tiny eye movements you don't notice)
    - Not **habituation** (attention process)! 
        * **Sensory adaptation** is:  _physiologically_ regulated, at the _sense organ_ level
            - Receptor cells themsleves become less responsive to a constant stimuli
            * Cannot overcome by increasing or descreasing attention
            * Based on changes in stimulus _intensity_
                - not length, number, or recency of prior stimulus exposure
* **Perceptual Illusions**
    - One approach to studying perception process
    - Some illusions cause you to perceive what is _not there_
        * So what we sense (physical qualities reaching) are not necessarily what we percieve
* **Perceptual Constancy**
    - Object percepts remains the same even though our sensation of the object changes
    - Example:
        * **Shape Constancy**: percept maintains same shape, despite change sin shape of proximal stimulus (also Size constantcy
    - Ponzo Illusion: Equivalent image sizes at different depths
        * Distally_converging lines_ are percieved as _depth_
    - **Equivalent size with depth** normally means **different-sized** objects (in **real world**)
* **Depth Perception**
    - The ability to see the world in 3 dimensions and detect distance
        * Vision only has a 2-dimensional view (promal stimulus on retina)
        * We must interpret the information given to _perceive_ depth
* **Monocular** Depth Cues
    - **Texture Gradients**: Grain of item 
    - **Relative Size**: Bigger is closer 
    - **Interposition**: Closer are in front of other object
    - **Linear Perspective**: Parallel lines converge in distance
    - **Aerial Perspetive**: Images seem blurry, the farther away they are
    - **Motion Parallax**: Objects get smaller at decreasing speed in distance
    - M.C Escher's Waterfall -- monocular
    - Carlo Crivelli -- Annunciation
* **Binocular** Depth Cues
    - **Binocular Convergence**: Eyes turn inward as object moves towards you, brain uses information to judge distance
    - **Binocular Disparity**: Each eye views a slightly different angle of an object; brain uses this to create a 3-d image
* **Object Perception**
    - **Viewer-Centered Representation**: We store in memory visual representation of objects base don how we see them.
        * Multiple views of each object dpending on wher eyou vs. object are located/positioned.
        * Image is viewpoint dependent, 2D template
    - **Object-Cenetered Rperesentation**
        * Object is stored in a way that best represnts it, regardless of how it is viewed.
            - Locations of parts of object are speicfied relative to each other
        * Image is viewpoint invariant, 3D structure
* **Inversion Effects**
    - Faces are ahrd to recognized when inverted
        * Sugges viewpoint matters for face recognition
* **Object Percption**
    - Evidence support _both_ viewer & object centered perception
    - How to reconcile?
        * Maybe two ends of a contiuum that both contirbute to object reocngntion
        * Burgunt & Tarr: Under what circumstances do we use each process?
    - May depedn on whic representaiton is more **efficeint**
        * How about the **earth** part of a globe
            - Just one 2d circle can represent the basic shape, accross any viewpoint
            - Same for a tomato
        * What about the base & handle parts of globe?
        * Onw object-centered 3d structure may be more efficeint
        * Same for specifric land masse on the globe or a horse
* Landmark-centered Orientation
    - Inforamtion is coded by its relation to a well known or prominment item
    - Consider your college cmapus
        * What a promitemtn item you use to orient yourself on campus -- drillfield, burrus, torg
    - We can switch between these 3 representational strategies
        *  fMRI shows differnt frames of reference involve different brain areas
* Gestalt View of Perception
