Chapter 8 - Representation and Organization of Knowledge in Memory
===================================================================
- How does declarative knowledge interact with procedural?
- Declarative Knowledge
    * Stored in the mind (memory) as **concepts**
    * Concepts
        - A mental representation of an item and associated knowledge and beliefs
        - An idea about somehting that provides a way to understand the world
        - May be captured bya  single word (e.g. cat tools furniture)
        - Concepts allow us to simplify and organize our percived universe
            * So each stimulus isn't expreierneced and coded as complety unique
        - Building blocks of human thought and behavior
        - We use them to:
            * Mentally organize our experiences like sorting objects into categories
                - That thing is an animal is a dog is a shih-Tzu
            * Make inferences and predictions (implicit, 'commonsense' knowledge)
                - Do Bernse mountain dogs have livers?
                - How do you know?
            * Combine to form complex thoughts
                - Dogs are mammals all of which have livers
            * For communication and other behavior
                - How to respond during an encroaching thunderstorm vs. huricane
    * Category
        - Rule used to organize concepts
            * Denotes equivialnce among concepts based on common feature sor similary to a protoype
            * A class of similar things that share an essential core or set of properties
                - "Apple" as a category (kind of apples)
    * Different Types of COncepts/Categories
        - Natural Category/Concept
            * Occur naturally (e.g. plants, trees, cats)
        - Artifact Category/Concept
            * Created by humans (e.g. hammers, computers)
        - Ad Hoc Category/Concept
            * Created individually to suit a need
                - (e.g. things you need to be happy, things you do to please parents)
            * Vary across persons, situations, time (so not in dictionary)
        - Nominal-Kind Concept
            * Arbitrary label for something meeting certian pre-specified rules
                - e.g. "widow" = woman whos husband is deceased
                - Not always clear features (e.g. lover, jerk)
    * Declaritive Knowledge Models
        - Definind Features
        - Smiliary-Based
        - Feature-Prototype Syntesis
- Defining Features
    * Assumes the meaning of any concept consists of a set of features (elements)
    * Defining Features
        - Must have this element to be considered a member of the category
        - Other features might be common (characteristic) but not defining
        - E.g. what are the defining features of a mime?
    * Problem with Defining Feature
        - Diffucult to specify necssary features of some concepts
            * What is the defining feature of a monster/
            * Family?
            * Wedding?
        - Typicality Effect
            * Some things are better examples of a concept than others
                - Robin is a more typpical bird than an ostrich
- Prototype Theory
    * Prototype = Average of Category Members
        - Prototype doesn't exist in reality
    * Abstracted representation of a category containing salient features that are true of most instances
    * Characteristic features
        - Common, but not necassary
        - Which describe what members of that concept are like
        - E.g. Monster protoype has these characterstics: scary, pale, sharp teel, evil, liees in odd places
            * Vampires, Zombies, Bogeymena ll fit that protoype well
            * Can a green grump liv ein a garbage can monster also git
                - Yes, but not as well
        - Deals well with fuzzy concepts
        - Fuzzy concepts = categories that cannot be easily defined (Monsters, Games)
        - TO see if it fits the category, we simply compare exemplar (real example) to the protoype
- Exemplar View
    * No single prototype but rather multiple real examples (exemplars) convey idea what the concept represents
    * Vegtable Concept = Peas, Carrots, or beans
    * is a green peper a vegtable?
    * The more similar a specific exemplar is to a known category member, the faster it will be categorized
    * Similar to Protoype View
        - Represnation is not a definition
    * but differnt: represnetaiton is not abstract
    * To categorize, compare to
- Syntehsis: Combine Prototype & Defining Feature
    * Evidence for both, so combine
    * Introduce the idea of the "core"
        - Defining features that item must have
    * Prototype
        - Characstics typical of examples
- Development of understanding of Defining Features
    * Keil & Batterman (1984)
        - 5-10 yr old exposed to category
        - Smelly mean old man with gun that took TV because parents told him he could have it
        - Friendly cheerful woman who took toilet without permissoin and no itention to return it
        - Not until age 10 ddid children see cheerful woman as robber
- Theory-Based View
    * of Knowledge Categorization
    * Departs from feature-based, prototype-based, or exemplar-based views
    * Says we categorize concepts based on implicit theories we have about them
        - aka "explanation-based view"
    * Knowledge of the world informs and shapres our predictions about concepts
    * A complex network of explanatory links helps us determine
        - Relative importanc eof features
            * (essential, cvs indicental or accidental)
        - Relations mong features
            * e.g. what is a good sport
        - Theory based view syas we use past experience to construct a more complex explanation
            * Good sprt = "Someone who is gracious in victory, doesn't mock losers, loses graciously, doesnt blame winner
        - We don't just isolate a few defining features )compoentital view) or chatacteristic features (prototyupe view), or good exmpales (exemplare view)
- Rips: 1989 Tested Theory-based View
    * Sorp/Soon Story: A bird-like "sorp" becomes an insect-like "doon"
        - Bird & ins
        - Implies **accidental**
