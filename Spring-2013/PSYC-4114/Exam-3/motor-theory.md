- **Motor Theory of Speech Perception**
    - Says movement of speaker's vocal tract provide a listener with phonemic info, which aids speech percpetion
    - Like McGurk effect, suggests speech perception is **special**
        * **McGurk Effect**
            - Disruption of normal synthesis of visual and auditory speech signals in speech perception when soundtrack doesn't correspond to speaker's lip movements
            - "da" sound + "ba" movement heard as compromised "tha" sound
        * Evidence: Same regions of primary motor cortex that produce speech are involved in speech perception/recognition
        * Can disrupt these regions in listner
            - Transcranial magnetic stimulation
        * Listner can no longer distinguish continous sounds that involve lip & tounge in articulation
            - Imparied caegorical perception of "ba" and "da"
        * In contrast, perception of sounds that don't involve lip articulation is not imparied
            - Can still distinguish "ka" and "ga"
- Discourse
    * Language use beyond the sentence level
        - Conversation, paragraphs, stories, chapters, entire works of literature
        - Discourse passages are structured in a systematic fashion
        - Psycholinguists study how we: 
            * Know to whom pronouns refer (he, her, it, etc..)
            * Understand the logical order of sentences in a passage
            * Use contex to infer meaning of words in sentences
                - Physical, social, cultural
        - We won't cover discourse further
