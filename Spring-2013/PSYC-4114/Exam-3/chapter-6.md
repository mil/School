Chapter 6 - Memory Processes
============================
- Retrieval from LTM
    * Types of **organizational cues** used you use to retrieve may affect what you retrieve
        - Bower, Clar, Lesgold, and Winzenz (1969)
            * Stuy a random list or an organized list
            * Free recall vs. categorized recall
                - notes: this was seperate study by Tulving & Pearstone
    * What is the impact on memory retrieval?
        - Bowever: Does cateroazation at encoding help retrieval?
            * Study randomizecd word list, or organized word list
            * Found:
                - Pariticpants remeber 65% of organized list
                - Only 19% of random list
                - Thus: organization at encoding helps retrieval
        - Tulving et al: Does categorization cued again at retrival help?
            * Retirval percormance can also dpeend on cues at retirval
            * Heard cateory name (clothing) then words in category
            * Those who did free frecall task performed far worse than those who were givne a cued recall task
                - (tested category by category
    * So we have trouble remeber somthing
        - Is it because we failed to store it
        - Or because we failed to retieve it
    * When we do rember better (e.g elaborative rehersal) is it due to improved storage, or imporved retrieval?
    * Good questions. BUt how to measure storage and retrieval seperatly?
        - Behavioral (RT, error rates) and physiological measures don't distinguish them.
    * Chechile & colleasues: multinomainal processing tree (MPT)
        - Uses compelx mathematical models and tasks to speratly measure
            * Wha tporpotion of information ges stoed
            * of stored info, what proportion is retrieved?
            * Some intersting findings
                - Korsakoff syndrome: retirval problems
                - Dyslexia (reading disorder): degraded storage
- If you cannot retireve from LTM
    * has memory idssapeard?
        - If we can't retrieve it...
    * Is the memory avialable but not accesible?
        - **Availability** = presence of info stored in LTM
            * Unabvilable = truly gone; absent froms torage
                - e.g a friends name isnt in your memory so you can't recall it
                - LIbraryt analogy: amterials in lirbary vs. not owned/missing
                - Hammer ytour looking for isnt in the shed
        - Acessiblity
            * Degree to which we can retrieve (gan acces to) the avilable info
                - Inaccessible = migh be avaible (present, but can't retive 
                - Might need some help - a cue
                    * e.g being told your friend's name's initals
                    * lirbrary anaology: matierlas in library nut not sheleved properly
                    * hammer in shed but buried under somthing
        * easier to measure accessibliity (retival)_ than avilably (stored0
- Still There Theory (Nelson)
    * Gave paired associate list
        - 43 : House
        - 67 : Dog
        - 77 : Sissors
    * Gave cued Recall Test after two week delay
        - 43 : ______
        - 67 : ______
    * Subjects recalled 75% of items on list after 2 week delay
    * Were they actually gone?
    * If participants forgot 38-dress and 77-scissors, then participants relearned either those **same** pairs or **changed** pairs
        - Found ebtter cued recall for **relearned** pairs (samecondition)
            * than **new** pairs (changed condition)
            * Otherwise, bothj groups would remeber the same amount
            * Forgtoten info was "still there" (avialable), just not easilyu rerieved (acessible)
- Theories about **Forgetting**
    * **Decay Theory**
        - Memory is wekaened with disuse
        - Fades over simple passge of time...
    * **Interference Theory**
        - Recall of certain things interferes with recall of others
        - **Proactive** Interference
            * *Old* memories interferes with recall of new information
            * Intering material occurs **before** learning the thing you want to retrieve
        - **Retroactive** Interference
            * New memories interfere with recall of old information
            * Caused  by activity **after** learning something but before retrieving it
    * Interferences versus Decay in STM (Brown-Peterson Paradigm)
        - Paricipants heard 3 constonatnts to try to remeber
            * (e.g., FRL) = a "triagram"
        - Then given a 3 diget number (294)
        - Asked to count out loud backwards by threes   
            * e.g., 291, 288, 285
        - Trials
            * Trial 1: Heard: GRL while saying 291
            * Trial 2: Heard: BHM while saying 288... etc. for 10 trials
            * Counting backwards causes **articulary suppresion**
            * Prevents subvocal rehersal of letters in the retention interval
                - Allows  **decay**: memory loss over time due to **disuse**
        - Results:
            * Trigrams were forgotten by 18 seconds
            * B & P suggested it was due to **decay** caused by counting backwards
    * **Proactive** Interference in STM (Keppel & Underwood 1962)
        - Replicated Brown & peterson Task varying the time delay to recall
        - Analysis was done by trial numbers
            * 1st, 2nd, 3rd trial, etc...
        - Found support for **proactive** interference
            * Recall for trigram in the first trial was still fine at 18 seconds
            * But later trials whoed poorer recall
                - (which influences B & P findings)
                - Articulatory suprresion of subvocal rehresal -> disuse
            * Past memory (earlier trigrams) interfere with forming new memories
    * **Retroactive** Interference from LTM
        - Experimental & Control Group
            * Learn List A, Learn
        - Experimental group will remeber less material from the tested list A compared to the controlg roup
        - Information learned afterwardes (list B, new info) interferes retroactivly with retirval of List A (old info)
    * **Proactive**
        - Experimntal group remeber less material from the tested list B than the control group
        - Information perviously learned (list A, old info) interferes proactivly with retrievla of List B (new info)
    * **Interference Theory**
        - Proactive
            * Old memories interfere with recall of new information
        * Retroactive
            - New memories interfere wiht recall of old information
- Constructive Nature of Memory 
    * Memory is **reconstructive**
        - Use strageis (search clues, infer) to retirve original memory traces
            * and rebuild original experience
    * It is also **constructive**
        - Prior experience affects how and what we recall from memory
        - Subject to distoritions
        - e.g., Autobiogrpahical memory
            * also callled: episodic memory
    * Constructive Nature of LTM (BArtlett 1932)
        - First to demonstrate memory distroions for prose:
            * Read stories about Native Americans
            * Subjects were good at recalling "gist" information, omitted details
            * Omission of detail was **systematic**
    * Prior experience influences how we recall information
    * Having **retriveal cues**
    * Owens, Bower, and Black (1979)
        -Some pariticpants also hear that passage but with this **theme**
        - The "theme" offered some background information and some retrival cues, which increased recall
        - However background lead to **more intrusions** (memory for information not present)
