Chapter 6 - Memory Processes
============================
- Retrieval from LTM
    * Types of **organizational cues** used you use to retrieve may affect what you retrieve
        - Bower, Clar, Lesgold, and Winzenz (1969)
            * Stuy a random list or an organized list
            * Free recall vs. categorized recall
                - notes: this was seperate study by Tulving & Pearstone
    * What is the impact on memory retrieval?
        - Bowever: Does cateroazation at encoding help retrieval?
            * Study randomizecd word list, or organized word list
            * Found:
                - Pariticpants remeber 65% of organized list
                - Only 19% of random list
                - Thus: organization at encoding helps retrieval
        - Tulving et al: Does categorization cued again at retrival help?
            * Retirval percormance can also dpeend on cues at retirval
            * Heard cateory name (clothing) then words in category
            * Those who did free frecall task performed far worse than those who were givne a cued recall task
                - (tested category by category
    * So we have trouble remeber somthing
        - Is it because we failed to store it
        - Or because we failed to retieve it
    * When we do rember better (e.g elaborative rehersal) is it due to improved storage, or imporved retrieval?
    * Good questions. BUt how to measure storage and retrieval seperatly?
        - Behavioral (RT, error rates) and physiological measures don't distinguish them.
    * Chechile & colleasues: multinomainal processing tree (MPT)
        - Uses compelx mathematical models and tasks to speratly measure
            * Wha tporpotion of information ges stoed
            * of stored info, what proportion is retrieved?
            * Some intersting findings
                - Korsakoff syndrome: retirval problems
                - Dyslexia (reading disorder): degraded storage
- If you cannot retireve from LTM
    * has memory idssapeard?
        - If we can't retrieve it...
    * Is the memory avialable but not accesible?
        - Availability = presence of info stored in LTM
            * Unabvilable = truly gone; absent froms torage
                - e.g a friends name isnt in your memory so you can't recall it
                - LIbraryt analogy: amterials in lirbary vs. not owned/missing
                - Hammer ytour looking for isnt in the shed
        - Acessiblity
            * Degree to which we can retrieve (gan acces to) the avilable info
                - Inaccessible = migh be avaible (present, but can't retive 
                - Might need some help - a cue
                    * e.g being told your friend's name's initals
                    * lirbrary anaology: matierlas in library nut not sheleved properly
                    * hammer in shed but buried under somthing
        * easier to measure accessibliity (retival)_ than avilably (stored0
- Still There Theory (Nelson)
    * Gave paired associate list
