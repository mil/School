Chapter 6 - Memory Processes
============================
- Retrieval from LTM
    * Types of **organizational cues** used you use to retrieve may affect what you retrieve
        - Bower, Clar, Lesgold, and Winzenz (1969)
            * Stuy a random list or an organized list
            * Free recall vs. categorized recall
                - notes: this was seperate study by Tulving & Pearstone
    * What is the impact on memory retrieval?
        - Bowever: Does cateroazation at encoding help retrieval?
            * Study randomizecd word list, or organized word list
            * Found:
                - Pariticpants remeber 65% of organized list
                - Only 19% of random list
                - Thus: organization at encoding helps retrieval
        - Tulving et al: Does categorization cued again at retrival help?
            * Retirval percormance can also dpeend on cues at retirval
            * Heard cateory name (clothing) then words in category
            * Those who did free frecall task performed far worse than those who were givne a cued recall task
                - (tested category by category
    * So we have trouble remeber somthing
        - Is it because we failed to store it
        - Or because we failed to retieve it
    * When we do rember better (e.g elaborative rehersal) is it due to improved storage, or imporved retrieval?
    * Good questions. BUt how to measure storage and retrieval seperatly?
        - Behavioral (RT, error rates) and physiological measures don't distinguish them.
    * Chechile & colleasues: multinomainal processing tree (MPT)
        - Uses compelx mathematical models and tasks to speratly measure
            * Wha tporpotion of information ges stoed
            * of stored info, what proportion is retrieved?
            * Some intersting findings
                - Korsakoff syndrome: retirval problems
                - Dyslexia (reading disorder): degraded storage
- If you cannot retireve from LTM
    * has memory idssapeard?
        - If we can't retrieve it...
    * Is the memory avialable but not accesible?
        - **Availability** = presence of info stored in LTM
            * Unabvilable = truly gone; absent froms torage
                - e.g a friends name isnt in your memory so you can't recall it
                - LIbraryt analogy: amterials in lirbary vs. not owned/missing
                - Hammer ytour looking for isnt in the shed
        - Acessiblity
            * Degree to which we can retrieve (gan acces to) the avilable info
                - Inaccessible = migh be avaible (present, but can't retive 
                - Might need some help - a cue
                    * e.g being told your friend's name's initals
                    * lirbrary anaology: matierlas in library nut not sheleved properly
                    * hammer in shed but buried under somthing
        * easier to measure accessibliity (retival)_ than avilably (stored0
- Still There Theory (Nelson)
    * Gave paired associate list
        - 43 : House
        - 67 : Dog
        - 77 : Sissors
    * Gave cued Recall Test after two week delay
        - 43 : ______
        - 67 : ______
    * Subjects recalled 75% of items on list after 2 week delay
    * Were they actually gone?
    * If participants forgot 38-dress and 77-scissors, then participants relearned either those **same** pairs or **changed** pairs
        - Found ebtter cued recall for **relearned** pairs (samecondition)
            * than **new** pairs (changed condition)
            * Otherwise, bothj groups would remeber the same amount
            * Forgtoten info was "still there" (avialable), just not easilyu rerieved (acessible)
- Theories about **Forgetting**
    * **Decay Theory**
        - Memory is wekaened with disuse
        - Fades over simple passge of time...
    * **Interference Theory**
        - Recall of certain things interferes with recall of others
        - **Proactive** Interference
            * *Old* memories interferes with recall of new information
            * Intering material occurs **before** learning the thing you want to retrieve
        - **Retroactive** Interference
            * New memories interfere with recall of old information
            * Caused  by activity **after** learning something but before retrieving it
    * Interferences versus Decay in STM (Brown-Peterson Paradigm)
        - Paricipants heard 3 constonatnts to try to remeber
            * (e.g., FRL) = a "triagram"
        - Then given a 3 diget number (294)
        - Asked to count out loud backwards by threes   
            * e.g., 291, 288, 285
        - Trials
            * Trial 1: Heard: GRL while saying 291
            * Trial 2: Heard: BHM while saying 288... etc. for 10 trials
            * Counting backwards causes **articulary suppresion**
            * Prevents subvocal rehersal of letters in the retention interval
                - Allows  **decay**: memory loss over time due to **disuse**
        - Results:
            * Trigrams were forgotten by 18 seconds
            * B & P suggested it was due to **decay** caused by counting backwards
    * **Proactive** Interference in STM (Keppel & Underwood 1962)
        - Replicated Brown & peterson Task varying the time delay to recall
        - Analysis was done by trial numbers
            * 1st, 2nd, 3rd trial, etc...
        - Found support for **proactive** interference
            * Recall for trigram in the first trial was still fine at 18 seconds
            * But later trials whoed poorer recall
                - (which influences B & P findings)
                - Articulatory suprresion of subvocal rehresal -> disuse
            * Past memory (earlier trigrams) interfere with forming new memories
    * **Retroactive** Interference from LTM
        - Experimental & Control Group
            * Learn List A, Learn
        - Experimental group will remeber less material from the tested list A compared to the controlg roup
        - Information learned afterwardes (list B, new info) interferes retroactivly with retirval of List A (old info)
    * **Proactive**
        - Experimntal group remeber less material from the tested list B than the control group
        - Information perviously learned (list A, old info) interferes proactivly with retrievla of List B (new info)
    * **Interference Theory**
        - Proactive
            * Old memories interfere with recall of new information
        * Retroactive
            - New memories interfere wiht recall of old information
- Constructive Nature of Memory 
    * Memory is **reconstructive**
        - Use strageis (search clues, infer) to retirve original memory traces
            * and rebuild original experience
    * It is also **constructive**
        - Prior experience affects how and what we recall from memory
        - Subject to distoritions
        - e.g., Autobiogrpahical memory
            * also callled: episodic memory
    * Constructive Nature of LTM (BArtlett 1932)
        - First to demonstrate memory distroions for prose:
            * Read stories about Native Americans
            * Subjects were good at recalling "gist" information, omitted details
            * Omission of detail was **systematic**
    * Prior experience influences how we recall information
    * Having **retriveal cues**
    * Owens, Bower, and Black (1979)
        -Some pariticpants also hear that passage but with this **theme**
        - The "theme" offered some background information and some retrival cues, which increased recall
        - However background lead to **more intrusions** (memory for information not present)
- Schacter's "Seven Sins of Memory"
    * Memories are transient (less acessible with time)
    * Absent-Mindedness / Lapses of Attention
        - Poor attention at encoding or retrieval diffuclties
            * Forget whre you put things (keys, galsses, car) or an appointment
    * OUt memories can be temporarily blocked (inaccessible)
        - E.g. Tip of the tounge phenomemon (know someon's name but can't recall it)
    * We can misatrribute the source of memory
        - We often forget where we learned something
    * We are suggestible in our meories
        - Leading questions can create false memories (e.g eyewitness errors)
    * We can show memory distortion (bias)
        - CUrrent unhappiness: negative skew on memory of past events
    * We often fail to forget the things
- Eyewitness Memory
    * The single greatest cause of wrongful convictions nationwide, playing a role in more than 75% off conviction sovertunred through DNA testing
- Loftus and Palmer (1974)
    * Participants swhown smae video of accident between two cars
    * Some subjects asked How fast were the cars going wehn they () into each other
        - Smashed - 41mph
        - Collided - 39mph
        - Bumped - 38mph
        - Hit - 34 mph
        - Contacted - 32mph
- Problems with Lineups
    * Assumption that perpetrator is in lineup
    * Distractor selection is also important
    * police behvaior may also influence
    * What is being done? US Justice Dept.
        - Inform witness perpetrator might not be in lineup
        - Use fillers in lineup similar to suspect
            * Can incrase misses* But also greatyl reduces false alrams
        - Use sequential presentation ( not simultanous lineup)
            * Shifts Q in eyewitness mind
                - From: Which one is most like the person I saw
                - To: Did I see that person?
        - Imporve intervewing techniques
            * Cognitive interview (considers how memory workds)
                - Open-ended , nonleading questions
                - Help them mentally recreate scene
- Children's Eyewitness Memory
    * Be wary of repeated questiong
    * leading questions may distory memory
    * Younger children are more suggestibl
- False Memories/ Memory Illusions
    * Roediger & Mcdermott (1995)
        - Presnt list of asscoated words, missing one target word (e.g. tired, bed, night, dream, etc but not SLEEP)
        - WIth immediate recall, participants tend to recall the non-rpresented target item
        - More importantly when asked wheter they remeber or know the words was on the list
    * Garry, Manning, Loftus, Sherman (1996)
        - Paricipants compeleted Life events inventory 0 things they experienced in life
        - Then are led through imaginitaiton exercises
            * Pretend you did this..
        - Fill our LEI again
        - Reuslts: when pariticpant ss imagine events that they said did not happen to them, they are more likely to say they did happen to them
        - Just imaging you did osmething makes it more likely you false memory reccolection
- Repressed or Recovered Memories of Abuse
    * E.g. A person remembers now that 20 year ago, someone sexually abused them
    * Traumati c memories seemingly was previously "repressed" but was recovered (often) under hypnosis in therapy
    * Does this uggest validity of recovered meomries?
        - Emprical evidence for Freudian rpression?
- Cna Painful Abuse memories be Repressed?
    * Repression: unconciosu exclusion of desires, impulses, and memories from consiusness
        - Note: not "motivated forgetting" as sometimes called
            * If actually forgotten, its not longer stored and thus not ever retrievable
    * Dissociation: unexpeceted, unexplainable (by person) partial or complete disruption of the normal integration of mental fucntioning:
        - Servered connected between thoughts, memories, feelings, actions, sense of identity
    * Skeptics argue that repression ( or in some cases dissociation) of sexual memorie sis a concept without any scientific merit
    * If repression does not exist, there cannot be such a thing as recovered prepessed memory. Rather a recovered memory of abuse can only be a false memory of abuse
- False Memory vs. Repressed Memory
    * Does proof of one rule out the other?
    * Evidence for suggested false memory is **not** automatically evidence against repressed-recovered memories
    * Evidence for repressed memories does not prove there's not suhc thing as a false memory
- No Consensus on the Issue
    * Its complicated and contentious
    * Results vary dependent upon charactersitic sample and study (volunteers, children, child services, audlt recall, etc.)
    * Some abuse memories are not traumatic, and thus are presumably not repressed, rather they may be forgotten, like any memory
    * Post-traunmatic stress syndrome may also occua
- COntext Effects on Encoding & Retrieval
    * Flashbulb memories: memory for events so vivid as if preseved on film
        - Expecially when important, suprigin, emotional impact
    * Finding sof vidi recall when participants asked: where were you when...
        - JFK was assisnated
        - Challendger explosion occursed
        - OJ verdict

    * Flashbulb Memories
        - Some research proposes viid meories
            * place wher eyou learned of information
- Emotion and Memory
    * There is a strong relationship (r=.9) between the emotionality and vivdeness of memory but...
        - Not necessarily more reliable or accurate
- Flashbulb Memory: Findings
    * Neisser and Harsch (1992)
        - Tested immediate memory for Challendger Shuttle explosiion, and then testied it again
- Amabile & Rovee-Collier (1991)
    * Encoding specificity even seen in infants!
    * 3 & 6 month old infants were taught in crib to kick a pacticular bumper background to move a mobile
