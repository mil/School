Chapter 7 - Knowledge
=====================
- **Form** of Knowledge Represented
- **Imagery**:
    * Mentally represent images
    * Mental representation of things 
        - Not currently being sensed by the sense organs
    * (So not just percepts) (Kosslyn 1977)
    * Ex. Sights, sound, smells, etc of objects or events (experience or imagined)
    * Most research is on visual imagery
        - e.g. What's darker, a cherry or an apple)
    * Image representations are fairly analogous to visual perception
        - e.g.) Mental rotation, scaling & scanning of represented objects
- **Symbolic Code**:
    * Arbitrary representation of something by something else
    * e.g. 
        - words ("cat") and 
        - numbers ("9", digital clock #s as time)
    * Arbitrary, not analogous to perceived object
    * Has meaning only because we assign it
- **Dual-Code**
    * (Paivio, 1971)
    * Two mental codes
        - One for images
        - Another for symbols
- **Propositional Representations**
    * **Meanings** underlying relationships among two or more concepts
        - Represened in **abstract** form
    * Proposition: 
        - Smallest unit of knowledge that can stand as seperate assertion
            * i.e. can be judged as true or false
        - Combine concepts to describe any relationship:
            * Attributes, actions, positions, classification
            * Abstract meaning (gist) is encoded, exact details (e.g. order of units) not critical
            * e.g. the furry cat sits under tha bel = under tha bble, furry, sits the cat
    * Abstract form. 
        - Not in words or images, 
        - but might represnt those too
    * Used when concepts are ambiguous or abstract 
        - (e.g. what is justice)
- **Propositional Theory** (Anderson & Bower 1971)
    * Meaning unerlying relationships among concepts
    * Represneted in abstract form
    * Propsotion = smallest unit of knowledge stand seperate (T/F)
    * Combine concept sto describe relationship
        - e.g. the furry cat sits under th table
    * Used when concepts are arbitary or abstract
