Chapter 7 - Knowledge
=====================
- **Form** of Knowledge Represented
    * Imagery:
        - Mental representaiton of things 
            * Not currenly being sensed by the sense organs
        - (So not just percepts) (Kosslyn 1977)
        - Ex. Sights, sound, smells, etc of objects or events (experience or imagined)
        - Most reasearch is on visual imagrery
            * (e.g. What's darker, a cherry or an apple)
        - e.g.) Mental rotation, scaling & scanning of represented objects
    * Symbolic Code:
        - Arbitrary representaition of something by something else
            * e.g. words ("cat") and numbers ("9", digital clock #s as time)
        - Arbitary, not analagous to percieved object
            * Has meaning only beacuse we assign it
    * Dual-Code (Paivio, 1971)
        - Two mental codes
        - One for images
        * Another for symbols
    * Propositional Represneations
        - **Meanings** underlying relationships among two or more concepts
        - Represened in **abstract** form
        - Proposition: smallest unit of knowledge that can stand as a seperate assertion
            * i.e. can be judged as true or false
        - Combine concepts to describe any relationship:
            * attributes, actions, positions, classification
            * Abstract meaning (gist) is encoded, exact details (e.g. order of units) not critical
            * e.g. the furry cat sits under tha bel = under tha bble, furry, sits the cat
        - Abstract form. Not in words or images, but might represnt those too
        - Used when concepts are ambigious or abstract (e.g. what is justice)
