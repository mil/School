Chapter 8 - Representation and Organization of Knowledge in Memory
===================================================================
- How does declarative knowledge interact with procedural?
- Declarative Knowledge
    * Stored in the mind (memory) as **concepts**
    * Concepts
        - A mental representation of an item and associated knowledge and beliefs
        - An idea about somehting that provides a way to understand the world
        - May be captured bya  single word (e.g. cat tools furniture)
        - Concepts allow us to simplify and organize our percived universe
            * So each stimulus isn't expreierneced and coded as complety unique
        - Building blocks of human thought and behavior
        - We use them to:
            * Mentally organize our experiences like sorting objects into categories
                - That thing is an animal is a dog is a shih-Tzu
            * Make inferences and predictions (implicit, 'commonsense' knowledge)
                - Do Bernse mountain dogs have livers?
                - How do you know?
            * Combine to form complex thoughts
                - Dogs are mammals all of which have livers
            * For communication and other behavior
                - How to respond during an encroaching thunderstorm vs. huricane
    * Category
        - Rule used to organize concepts
            * Denotes equivialnce among concepts based on common feature sor similary to a protoype
            * A class of similar things that share an essential core or set of properties
                - "Apple" as a category (kind of apples)
    * Different Types of COncepts/Categories
        - Natural Category/Concept
            * Occur naturally (e.g. plants, trees, cats)
        - Artifact Category/Concept
            * Created by humans (e.g. hammers, computers)
        - Ad Hoc Category/Concept
            * Created individually to suit a need
                - (e.g. things you need to be happy, things you do to please parents)
            * Vary across persons, situations, time (so not in dictionary)
        - Nominal-Kind Concept
            * Arbitrary label for something meeting certian pre-specified rules
                - e.g. "widow" = woman whos husband is deceased
                - Not always clear features (e.g. lover, jerk)
    * Declaritive Knowledge Models
        - Definind Features
        - Smiliary-Based
        - Feature-Prototype Syntesis
- Defining Features
    * Assumes the meaning of any concept consists of a set of features (elements)
    * Defining Features
        - Must have this element to be considered a member of the category
        - Other features might be common (characteristic) but not defining
        - E.g. what are the defining features of a mime?
    * Problem with Defining Feature
        - Diffucult to specify necssary features of some concepts
            * What is the defining feature of a monster/
            * Family?
            * Wedding?
        - Typicality Effect
            * Some things are better examples of a concept than others
                - Robin is a more typpical bird than an ostrich
- Prototype Theory
    * Prototype = Average of Category Members
        - Prototype doesn't exist in reality
    * Abstracted representation of a category containing salient features that are true of most instances
    * Characteristic features
        - Common, but not necassary
        - Which describe what members of that concept are like
        - E.g. Monster protoype has these characterstics: scary, pale, sharp teel, evil, liees in odd places
            * Vampires, Zombies, Bogeymena ll fit that protoype well
            * Can a green grump liv ein a garbage can monster also git
                - Yes, but not as well
        - Deals well with fuzzy concepts
        - Fuzzy concepts = categories that cannot be easily defined (Monsters, Games)
        - TO see if it fits the category, we simply compare exemplar (real example) to the protoype
- Exemplar View
    * No single prototype but rather multiple real examples (exemplars) convey idea what the concept represents
    * Vegtable Concept = Peas, Carrots, or beans
    * is a green peper a vegtable?
    * The more similar a specific exemplar is to a known category member, the faster it will be categorized
    * Similar to Protoype View
        - Represnation is not a definition
    * but differnt: represnetaiton is not abstract
    * To categorize, compare to
- Syntehsis: Combine Prototype & Defining Feature
    * Evidence for both, so combine
    * Introduce the idea of the "core"
        - Defining features that item must have
    * Prototype
        - Characstics typical of examples
- Development of understanding of Defining Features
    * Keil & Batterman (1984)
        - 5-10 yr old exposed to category
        - Smelly mean old man with gun that took TV because parents told him he could have it
        - Friendly cheerful woman who took toilet without permissoin and no itention to return it
        - Not until age 10 ddid children see cheerful woman as robber
- Theory-Based View
    * of Knowledge Categorization
    * Departs from feature-based, prototype-based, or exemplar-based views
    * Says we categorize concepts based on implicit theories we have about them
        - aka "explanation-based view"
    * Knowledge of the world informs and shapres our predictions about concepts
    * A complex network of explanatory links helps us determine
        - Relative importanc eof features
            * (essential, cvs indicental or accidental)
        - Relations mong features
            * e.g. what is a good sport
        - Theory based view syas we use past experience to construct a more complex explanation
            * Good sprt = "Someone who is gracious in victory, doesn't mock losers, loses graciously, doesnt blame winner
        - We don't just isolate a few defining features )compoentital view) or chatacteristic features (prototyupe view), or good exmpales (exemplare view)
- Rips: 1989 Tested Theory-based View
    * Sorp/Soon Story: A bird-like "sorp" becomes an insect-like "doon"
        - Bird & ins
        - Implies **accidental** 

Chapter 8 -- Knowledge Representation & Organization
===================================================
- 
- **Semantic Network Models**
    * **Basics**
        - **Nodes** represent **concepts** in memory
        - **Links** represent **relationships** among sets of nodes (concepts)
        - Ex.
            * Node: Robin
            * Node : Wings
            * Two nodes are connected through *-- property link -->*
    * **Hierarchal Semantic Network Model** (Collins & Quillian 1969)
        - Structure is **hierarchical**
            * Lower level concepts fit under (within) higher level concepts
        - **Cognitive Economy**
            * Properties stored only at highest possible level
        - **Inheritence**
            * Lower-level items also share properties of higher level items
        - Time to retive information based on **number of links**
            * As such, it is testable
        - Supporting Evidence: Sentence verification task (Collins & Quillian 1969)
            * IS this sentence true or false? 
                - Measure: Reaction Time
                - Sentences: 
                    * Salmon are pink
                    * Animals breathe
                    * A dog has four legs
                    * A dalmatioan has skin
            * As predicted, the more links traveled in the model
                - The longer it akes (rt) to verify the truth of statements
        - Supporting Evidence: Lexical Decision Task (Meyer & Scvaneveldt 1971)
        - Contradicting Evidence (Carol Conrad 1972): Sentence verification Task
            * Measure reaciton time
            * Is this sentence true or false
                - A shark can move.
                - A fish can move.
                - An animal can move.
            * Cognitive Economy: says "can move" should be stored cloest to "animal"
                - (highest possible level in hierarchy): predict fastes RT to the last sentence
            * But.. Conrad found no differenc ein the three RTs.
            * SHe argued that **frequent association** of the property "can move" with each concept animal, shark, and fish predicts equal RTs
                - not **cognitive economy*
        - Contradicting Evidence Sentence Veritfication Task (Rips, SHoebn & Smith 1973)
            * A pig is an animal
            * A pig is a mammal
            * Hiererhical sturcture would put 'pig' node under (so closer to) 'mammal' node and ma
            * Also **typicality effect** unexplained:
                - People were faster at 
    * A Revision: Collins & Loftus (1975) Semantic Model
        - Like Collins & QUillian, they modeled semantic memory as
            * network with nodes correpsonding to concepts
            * related concepts connected by paths between nodes
        - But...
            * Dropped notions of hierachy * cognitive economy
            * Alllowed links to vary in length to account for typicality effects
                - "robin" is more typical thanRevision: "ostrich"
                - so "robin" node is closer to other bird nodes like "sparrow" and "dove
              * Introduced **spreading activiation**
                - Activationis the arousal levle of a node
                - SPreads down links
                - Used t
        - Advanage:
            * Can explain most findings well, better than C & Q Hierarhcial networ model (e.g. typicality effect)
                - Farly good 'explantory pwoer' & 'predictive power'
        - Disadvantage:
            * Its so broad that is diffucult to make clearn and strong predictions
            * WHat data would **falsify** this model?
                - Too flexible: no clearn rules for what determines length of links between nodes, how long activation remains after it spreads, how much total adctivation ,e tc..
            * Karl Popper
                - TO be scientific, hypotheses and theories must be falsifiable
                - "A theory that explains everything explains nothing" K.P.
                - Popper advocated "strong tests" = ones that can disprove one's own hypotheses
                - Note: while we often use terms like hypothesis, model, and theory interchangly, a true scientific theory hs to have surivived repreated attempts to prove it wrong with emperical data (e.g. theoy of evolution by natural selection)
            * Back to hierrchial categories of concepts COnsider those below
                - General/superoridinate levels contain specific suboridinate levels
            * Is there a "basic" special/priveled level of category in ecah hierachy
                - One that is more psychologically important? Gets used most often?
            * Eleanor Rosch research suggests ther is a basic/special level for each
                - But is that the same for everyone?
- Evidence that Basic Level is SPeical
    * People almost exclusivly use basic-level names in free-naming tasks
    * Children elearn basic-lvel concepts soonor than other levels
    * Basic level
- SO does everyone use the basic level
    * No
        - Expertise leads to greater use of subordinate lvel:w

- Schemas (schemata)
    * Bartlet
    * Schma = mental frameworks based on past experiences that are actively used to help us represtn and organize interelated concepts and make (suually) adpactive responses
        * Knowledge of what is inolved in a particular experinece
        * We are always comparing (preconsciously) the 'fit' between our current sutiation and schemas to make inference,s judgements, and decisions
    * Schemas vary in levle of abstraction from sall to large parts of knowledge
        - Letter formed by configuration of lines
        - What pet dogs are like
        - Piagelet "assimuliation"
    * Schema Research
        - TUckey * Brewer (2003)
            * mainuplated abiguiity and schme consistentcy
            * aminguious conditions taht are not schema-inconsistent tend to produce
                - poorer reclal for correct info
                - more schema-consistnet intrusions
- Scripts
    * Type of schema about events
        - Sequenece of actions that sually occur in a particular experience
        - When we ehar or read about scripeted event, our knowledge o entire:

- **Schemas & Scripts**
    * Proceduralization = non declarative construction of knowledge
    * Serial Processing
        * Linear sequence of operations
        * Create using production system (if then rules)
- ACR-R = Adaptive Control of Thought 
    * Declarative Knowledge
        - Represented in *Propositional Networks**
        - Chunks = network structures defined by type and slots
        - Each node receptive to stimulation form neighboring nodes, activation can spread via links across chunks
        - But limited activation capacity: not all notdes can be at once
