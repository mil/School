Chapter 8 - Representation and Organization of Knowledge in Memory
===================================================================
- How does **declarative knowledge** interact with **procedural**?
- **Declarative Knowledge**
    * Stored in the mind (memory) as **concepts**
    * **Concepts**
        - Mental representation of item 
            * Includes: Associated knowledge and beliefs
        - An idea about something 
            * Provides a way to understand the world
        - May be captured by single word 
            * (e.g. cat tools furniture)
        - Concepts allow us to simplify and organize our perceived universe
            * So each stimulus isn't expreierneced and coded as complety unique
        - Building blocks of human thought and behavior
        - We use them to:
            * Mentally organize our experiences like sorting objects into categories
                - That thing is an animal is a dog is a shih-Tzu
            * Make inferences and predictions (implicit, 'commonsense' knowledge)
                - Do Bernse mountain dogs have livers?
                - How do you know?
            * Combine to form complex thoughts
                - Dogs are mammals all of which have livers
            * Communication and other behavior
                - How to respond during an encroaching thunderstorm vs. huricane
    - **Category**
        * Rule used to organize concepts
        * Denotes equivialnce among concepts 
        * Based on common feature for similary to a protoype
            - A class of similar things that share an essential core or set of properties
            - "Apple" as a category (kind of apples)
    - Different **Types of Concepts/Categories**
        * **Natural Category/Concept**
            * Occur **naturally **
            * (e.g. plants, trees, cats)
        - **Artifact Category/Concept**
            * **Created by humans** for purpose/function
            * (e.g. hammers, computers)
        - **Ad Hoc Category/Concept**
            * Created individually to suit a need
            * (e.g. things you need to be happy, things you do to please parents)
            * Vary across persons, situations, time 
                - (so not in dictionary)
        - **Nominal-Kind Concept**
            * Arbitrary label for something meeting certian pre-specified rules
                - e.g. "widow" = woman whos husband is deceased
            * Not always clear features 
                - (e.g. lover, jerk)
- **Declarative Knowledge Models**
    * **Defining Features**
        - Assumes the meaning of any concept consists of a set of features (elements)
        - **Defining Features**
            - Must have this element to be considered a member of the category
            - Other features might be common (characteristic) but not defining
            - E.g. what are the defining features of a mime?
        - Problem with Defining Feature
            * Diffucult to specify necssary features of some concepts
            * What is the defining feature of a monster?
            * Family?
            * Wedding?
        - **Typicality Effect**
            * Some things are better examples of a concept than others
            * Robin is a more typical bird than an ostrich
    * **Prototype Theory**
        - **Prototype**
            * **Average of Category Members**
            * Prototype doesn't exist in reality
        - Abstracted representation of a category 
            * Containing salient features that are true of most instances
        - **Characteristic features**
            * Common, but not necassary
            * Which describe what members of that concept are like
            * E.g. Monster protoype has these characterstics: 
                - scary, pale, sharp teel, evil, liees in odd places
                - BUT: Vampires, Zombies, Bogeymena ll fit that protoype well
                - Can a green grump liv ein a garbage can monster also git
                    - Yes, but not as well
        - Deals well with fuzzy concepts
        - **Fuzzy Concepts**
            * Categories that cannot be easily defined 
            * (Monsters, Games)
            * TO see if it fits the category, 
                - Simply compare exemplar (real example) to the protoype
    * **Exemplar View**
        - No single prototype but rather multiple real examples (exemplars) convey idea 
            * What the concept represents
        - Vegtable Concept = 
            * Peas, Carrots, or beans
        - Is a green pepper a vegtable?
        - The more similar a specific exemplar is to a known category member
            * The faster it will be categorized
        - **Similar to Protoype View**
            - Represnation is not a definition
            - But differnt: **representation is not abstract**
        * To categorize, compare to
    * **Synthesis**: Combine Prototype & Defining Feature
        - Evidence for both, so combine
        - Introduce the idea of the "core"
            * **Defining features** that **item must have**
        - Prototype
            * Characstics typical of examples
- **Understanding of Defining Features**
    * Keil & Batterman (1984)
        - 5-10 yr old exposed to category
        - Smelly mean old man with gun that took TV because parents told him he could have it
        - Friendly cheerful woman who took toilet without permissoin and no itention to return it
        - Not until age 10 did children see cheerful woman as robber
    * **Theory-Based View of Knowledge Categorization**
        - Departs from feature-based, prototype-based, or exemplar-based views
        - Categorize concepts based on **implicit theories** we have 
            * aka **"explanation-based view"**
        - Knowledge of the world informs and shapes our predictions about concepts
        - complex network of explanatory links helps us determine
        - Relative importance of features
            * (essential, vs indicental or accidental)
        - **Relations among features**
            * e.g. what is a good sport
        - Use **past experience** to construct a more **complex explanation**
            * Good sprt = 
                - "Someone who is gracious in victory, doesn't mock losers, loses graciously, doesnt blame winner"
        - Don't 
            * Just isolate a few defining features (compoentital view) 
            * or Chatacteristic features (prototyupe view), 
            * or Good exmpales (exemplare view)
    * **Tested Theory-based View** (Rips: 1989)
        - Sorp/Soon Story: 
            * A bird-like "sorp" becomes an insect-like "doon"
        - Gelman support
            * Certain categories have deep underlying reality can't be directly observed
        - True nature determines category membership
        - Abstract **Essential** meaning rather than **Conrete thinking**
        - **Essentialism**: certain categories have deep underlying reality
            * Can't be directly observed
            * True nature determines category
- **Semantic Network Models**
    * **Basics**
        - **Nodes** represent **concepts** in memory
        - **Links** represent **relationships** among sets of nodes (concepts)
        - Ex.
            * Node: Robin
            * Node : Wings
            * Two nodes are connected through *-- property link -->*
    * **Hierarchal Semantic Network Model** 
        - (Collins & Quillian 1969)
        - Structure is **hierarchical**
            * Lower level concepts fit under (within) higher level concepts
        - **Cognitive Economy**
            * Properties stored only at highest possible level
        - **Inheritence**
            * Lower-level items also share properties of higher level items
        - **Time to retive information** 
            * Based on **number of links**
            * As such, it is testable
        - **Supporting Evidence**: Sentence verification task (Collins & Quillian 1969)
            * Is this sentence true or false? 
            * Measure: Reaction Time
                - Sentences: 
                    * Salmon are pink
                    * Animals breathe
                    * A dog has four legs
                    * A dalmatioan has skin
            * As predicted, the more links traveled in the model
                - The longer it takes (rt) to verify the truth of statements
        - **Supporting Evidence**: Lexical Decision Task (Meyer & Scvaneveldt 1971)
            * IS set of crambled letters a word/non-word?
            * Measure RT
            * As predicted, more quickly unscramble closely related (linked words)
            * E.g. shorter time to identify raebed (bread) as word when followed by
                - than utbert (butter)
                - slower with irahc (chair)
        - **Contradicting Evidence** (Carol Conrad 1972): Sentence verification Task
            * Measure reaciton time
            * Is this sentence true or false
                - A shark can move.
                - A fish can move.
                - An animal can move.
            * **Cognitive Economy**: says "can move" should be stored cloest to "animal"
                - (highest possible level in hierarchy): 
                    * predict fastes RT to the last sentence
            * But.. Conrad found **no difference in the three RTs**
            * SHe argued that **frequent association** of the property "can move" 
                - with each concept animal, shark, and fish predicts equal RTs
                - Not **cognitive economy*
        - **Contradicting Evidence**: Sentence Veritfication Task (Rips, Shoebn & Smith 1973)
            * A pig is an animal
            * A pig is a mammal
            * Hiererhical sturcture would put 'pig' node under (so closer to) 'mammal' node and mamaml under animal
                - Should be faster RT to pig is mammal
                - BUT, it was found pig is animal has fast RT
            * Also **typicality effect** unexplained:
                - People were faster at 'a rbon is a bird' than 'a rukey is a bird' despite robin and turkey being at the same level of the hierarchy
    * **Semantic Model** (A Revision: Collins & Loftus (1975))
        - Like Collins & QUillian, they modeled semantic memory as
            * Network with nodes correpsonding to concepts
            * Related concepts connected by paths between nodes
        - But...
            * **Dropped notions of hierachy & cognitive economy**
            * Alllowed links to vary in length to account for **typicality effects**
                - "robin" is more typical thanRevision: "ostrich"
                - So "robin" node is closer to other bird nodes like "sparrow" and "dove
              * Introduced **spreading activiation**
                - Activationis the arousal levle of a node
                - Spreads down links
                - Used to extract info from network
        - Advantage:
            * Can explain most findings well
            * Better than C & Q Hierarhcial networ model 
                - (e.g. typicality effect)
            - Farly good 'explantory pwoer' & 'predictive power'
        - **Disadvantage**:
            * Its so broad that is diffucult to make clearn and strong predictions
            * What data would **falsify** this model?
                - Too flexible - No clearn rules for:
                    * What determines length of links between nodes
                    - How long activation remains after it spreads
                    - How much total adctivation ,e tc..
            * Karl Popper
                - TO be scientific, hypotheses and theories must be falsifiable
                - "A theory that explains everything explains nothing" K.P.
                - Popper advocated "strong tests" = ones that can disprove one's own hypotheses
                - Note: while we often use terms like hypothesis, model, and theory interchangly, a true scientific theory hs to have surivived repreated attempts to prove it wrong with emperical data (e.g. theoy of evolution by natural selection)
    * **"Special" Basic-Level Categories**
        - Back to hierrchial categories of concepts 
        - COnsider those below
                - General/superoridinate levels contain specific suboridinate levels
        - Is there a "basic" special/priveled level of category in ecah hierachy
            * One that is more psychologically important? Gets used most often?
        - Eleanor Rosch research suggests ther is a basic/special level for each
            * But is that the same for everyone?
        - Evidence that Basic Level is SPeical
            * People almost exclusivly use basic-level names in free-naming tasks
            * Children learn basic-level concepts soonor than other levels
            * Basic-level more common in adult discourse than names for superordinate categories
            * differnt cultures tend to use same basic-levle categories, at least for living things
        - But not everyone use the same basic level
            * Expertise leads to greater use of subordinate level
            * ex. Bird watchers vs. non-experts
- **Schemas** (schemata)(Bartlet)
    * Mental Framework based on past experiences 
    * Actively used to help us represent and organize interrelated concepts 
    * make (Usually) adaptive responses
        * Knowledge of what is inolved in a particular experinece
        * We are always comparing (preconsciously) the 'fit' between 
            - Our current sutiation and schemas to make inferences, judgements, and decisions
    * Schemas vary in level of abstraction from small to large parts of knowledge
        - Letter formed by configuration of lines
        - What pet dogs are like
        - What love is
    * Analogous to a theory, represnting both **general knowledge**about th world and **info on parituclar aspects**:
        - Concepts, events, actions, reliationships
        - Incorporate 'default values' (expect roomate to be 18-19yrs old)
        - E.g. Schema for metting new college roomate
            * Includes info about nature of setting, characters, their interactions
    * Schema Research (Tuckey & Brewer (2003))
        - Film showed dpeicting bank robbery
        - Mainuplated abiguiity and schme consistentcy
        - Ambigious conditions that are not schema-inconsistent tend to produce
            * Poorer reclal for correct info
            * More schema-consistnet intrusions
            * More ambigious/schmea-consistent, worse recall... more likely to just categorize as a schema
    * Schema Research (Bower, Black & Turner, 1979)
        - People exposed to healthcare schema (doctor, dntist)
        - Asked confidence about events that didn't happen or did
        - More stories read evoking certain schema, cofidence influenced that schema-consisent event wa sin story
        - Ideas contain schema become part of memory with events experienced
    * Schema Research (Brewer and Treyens 1981)
        - Memory for grad student office
        - Participants report recall of expected objects
        - Some items not recalled by many (e.g. umbreall)
- **Scripts**
    * Type of schema about events
    * **Structure** captures general info about **routine** events
    * Scripts have typical sequence
        - Sequence of actions that usually occur in a particular experience
    * When we hear or read about scripted event, our knowledge of entire script is activated
        - Fill in/infer scenes/actions not explicitly mentioned
    * Schank and Abelman (1977):
        - Visit restratunt
            * Sit down, look at menu, order food, eat, pay, leave

- **Schemas & Scripts**
    * Proceduralization = non declarative construction of knowledge
    * **Serial Processing**
        - Linear sequence of operations
        - Create using **production system** rules (if then rules)
    * Tasks may take multiple rules
        - Organized into routines and subroutines
- ACT-R = **Adaptive Control of Thought**
    * Another network theory of memory
    * Attemps to model all human cognition (memory, languag,e problem solving, etc.)
    * Declarative and procedural knowledge
    * How knowledge is organized and use to produce behavior
    * ACT-R has successfully simulated:
        - Driving behavior
        - Rock patper scicsor, RT 
        - TOwer of Hanoi
        - Category leanring
        - List memory
    * Declarative Knowledge
        - Represented in *Propositional Networks**
        - Proposiiotn = smallest until of K, seperate asertion
        - Chunks = network structures defined by type and slots
        - Each node receptive to stimulation form neighboring nodes, activation can spread via links across chunks
        - But limited activation capacity: not all notdes can be at once
    * Declartive Network
        - Each node reptive to stimulation form neighboring nodes
        - Limited activation capactiy
        - Activation level weakes with distsance from inital source
        - Nodes stregnthend dependtn on use
        - Analogy: "Water flowing through interlinked pipes"
    * Acquisition of Procedural Knowledge:
        - 3 Stages of Procedurailization:
            * Explicit Stage
                - Consciously think about steps to complete task
            * Associative Stage
                - Pracitve procedure carefully and repeadtely
            * Composition Stage
                - Construct single production rule, effectivl embraces 2+ production rules
        - **Production Tuning**
            * learn to genralize existing rules to new conditions
                - e.g. apply same driving procedur to diffent car
            * learn to discriminate new criteria of new conditions
                - e.g. learn differnt gear positions to shift new car
- Squire's Non-Declarative Knowledge
    * Mentally represnt more than just procedural knowledge (percepts, motor, cog skills)
    * Other forms of non-declarative knowledge:
        - Associative conditioning
            * Classical and operant conditioning
        - Simple non-associative knowledge
            * Habituation
            * Sensitiatization
        - Priming
    * Support for Squire's Taxonomy
        - Basal ganglia Damage
        - Parkinson & Early Huntinton disease patients
        - No apparent amenai (declaritive memory in tact)
        - Problems with procedural memory
            * Perceptual motor learning
            * Habits & Skills
        - Just one ex. of variety of studies with humand and animals have supported Squire's taxonomy
    * Two Types of Priming
        - BLANK priming
            * Meaning is primed
            * Remeber Nurse-Doctor Study?
        - BLANK priming
            * prior exposure primes same items seen later
- Connectionist Model
    * Earlier info processing theories
        - Assum serial processing, like computers
    * Parallel processing theories
        - Multiple operations occur simultationously
    * Parallel Distributed Processing (PDP) models
        - e.g. McCelland & Rogers 2003
        - Goal is to model all info as mentally represnted and processed simultantously by brain
        - Also called "conntetionsit models"
        - Mdoel based on analogous to physical "neural network"
            * But describtes mental (non-physical) structures
            * Different from neural networks
    * Unlike semnatic networks repreation is distrbuted across network (not just on one node)
    * Knowledge for specific thing not stored epxlitity
        - Stored in acitavations of nodes amont untis
    * Learnng via expeirence results from change in connection strength (weights) via experience
    * Weighted connections: Untis send positive exicatory and negative inhbiatory signals to other unts
        - Analogous to neural circuts
    * Each unti in networkk is relativly uninformative
        - Become informitive when connections are activated
