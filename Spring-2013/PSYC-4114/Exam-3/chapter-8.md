Chapter 8 -- Knowledge Representation & Organization
===================================================
- **Semantic Network Models**
    * **Basics**
        - **Nodes** represent **concepts** in memory
        - **Links** represent **relationships** among sets of nodes (concepts)
        - Ex.
            * Node: Robin
            * Node : Wings
            * Two nodes are connected through *-- property link -->*
    * **Hierarchal Semantic Network Model** (Collins & Quillian 1969)
        - Structure is **hierarchical**
            * Lower level concepts fit under (within) higher level concepts
        - **Cognitive Economy**
            * Properties stored only at highest possible level
        - **Inheritence**
            * Lower-level items also share properties of higher level items
        - Time to retive information based on **number of links**
            * As such, it is testable
        - Supporting Evidence: Sentence verification task (Collins & Quillian 1969)
            * IS this sentence true or false? 
                - Measure: Reaction Time
                - Sentences: 
                    * Salmon are pink
                    * Animals breathe
                    * A dog has four legs
                    * A dalmatioan has skin
            * As predicted, the more links traveled in the model
                - The longer it akes (rt) to verify the truth of statements
        - Supporting Evidence: Lexical Decision Task (Meyer & Scvaneveldt 1971)
        - Contradicting Evidence (Carol Conrad 1972): Sentence verification Task
            * Measure reaciton time
            * Is this sentence true or false
                - A shark can move.
                - A fish can move.
                - An animal can move.
            * Cognitive Economy: says "can move" should be stored cloest to "animal"
                - (highest possible level in hierarchy): predict fastes RT to the last sentence
            * But.. Conrad found no differenc ein the three RTs.
            * SHe argued that **frequent association** of the property "can move" with each concept animal, shark, and fish predicts equal RTs
                - not **cognitive economy*
        - Contradicting Evidence Sentence Veritfication Task (Rips, SHoebn & Smith 1973)
            * A pig is an animal
            * A pig is a mammal
            * Hiererhical sturcture would put 'pig' node under (so closer to) 'mammal' node and ma
            * Also **typicality effect** unexplained:
                - People were faster at 
    * A Revision: Collins & Loftus (1975) Semantic Model
        - Like Collins & QUillian, they modeled semantic memory as
            * network with nodes correpsonding to concepts
            * related concepts connected by paths between nodes
        - But...
            * Dropped notions of hierachy * cognitive economy
            * Alllowed links to vary in length to account for typicality effects
                - "robin" is more typical thanRevision: "ostrich"
                - so "robin" node is closer to other bird nodes like "sparrow" and "dove
              * Introduced **spreading activiation**
                - Activationis the arousal levle of a node
                - SPreads down links
                - Used t
        - Advanage:
            * Can explain most findings well, better than C & Q Hierarhcial networ model (e.g. typicality effect)
                - Farly good 'explantory pwoer' & 'predictive power'
        - Disadvantage:
            * Its so broad that is diffucult to make clearn and strong predictions
            * WHat data would **falsify** this model?
                - Too flexible: no clearn rules for what determines length of links between nodes, how long activation remains after it spreads, how much total adctivation ,e tc..
            * Karl Popper
                - TO be scientific, hypotheses and theories must be falsifiable
                - "A theory that explains everything explains nothing" K.P.
                - Popper advocated "strong tests" = ones that can disprove one's own hypotheses
                - Note: while we often use terms like hypothesis, model, and theory interchangly, a true scientific theory hs to have surivived repreated attempts to prove it wrong with emperical data (e.g. theoy of evolution by natural selection)
            * Back to hierrchial categories of concepts COnsider those below
                - General/superoridinate levels contain specific suboridinate levels
            * Is there a "basic" special/priveled level of category in ecah hierachy
                - One that is more psychologically important? Gets used most often?
            * Eleanor Rosch research suggests ther is a basic/special level for each
                - But is that the same for everyone?
- Evidence that Basic Level is SPeical
    * People almost exclusivly use basic-level names in free-naming tasks
    * Children elearn basic-lvel concepts soonor than other levels
    * Basic level
- SO does everyone use the basic level
    * No
        - Expertise leads to greater use of subordinate lvel:w

- Schemas (schemata)
    * Bartlet
    * Schma = mental frameworks based on past experiences that are actively used to help us represtn and organize interelated concepts and make (suually) adpactive responses
        * Knowledge of what is inolved in a particular experinece
        * We are always comparing (preconsciously) the 'fit' between our current sutiation and schemas to make inference,s judgements, and decisions
    * Schemas vary in levle of abstraction from sall to large parts of knowledge
        - Letter formed by configuration of lines
        - What pet dogs are like
        - Piagelet "assimuliation"
    * Schema Research
        - TUckey * Brewer (2003)
            * mainuplated abiguiity and schme consistentcy
            * aminguious conditions taht are not schema-inconsistent tend to produce
                - poorer reclal for correct info
                - more schema-consistnet intrusions
- Scripts
    * Type of schema about events
        - Sequenece of actions that sually occur in a particular experience
        - When we ehar or read about scripeted event, our knowledge o entire:
