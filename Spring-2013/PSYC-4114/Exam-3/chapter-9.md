Chapter 9 - Language
====================
- **Psycholiguistics**
    * The **psychological** study of **language** including mental processes involved
    * Storage and other cognitive processes
        - How are perception, attention, memory processes involved 
            * In language production, comprhrenehsion and acquisition?
    * **Comprehenesion**
        - How do we understand spoken and written language?
        - How do we process language sounds?
        - Understand words, sentences, stories
            * Expressesd in writing, speech, sign language
        - How do we converse with one another?
    * **Physical Speech Production**
        - How do we learn language?
        - How children learn the native language?
        - How do we acquire additional languages?
- **Language**
    * Organized, rule-governed way to communicate 
        - Using finite set of sounds and symbols to express an infinite range of information
        - Feelings, thoughts, ideas, experiences
        - Involves both:
            * **Receptive** (comprhension) and 
            * **Expressive** (production, verbal fluency) abilities
    * **Unique to humans**
        - Non-human primates use language in some similar ways
        - BUT Most animal communication lacks the unique properties of human lanugage.
    * Involves 
        - Learned (environment) and
        - Innate (inherited) components
    * Learned (enviroment) & innate (inherited) components:
        - Skinner's 1959 book: Verbal Behavior
            * We use language simply through conditioning
                - Rewarded for "good" and punished for "bad" language behavior
        - Noam Chomsky's 1959: Syntatic Structures:
            * Scathing review of Skinner's 'verbal behavior'
            * Language occurs across all cultures
                - All have similar underlying structure (verbs, nouns; questions; negatives, past/present)
            * Children devleop language skills the same way (babbling, etc)
            * Children produce sentences that were never previously reinforced
                - "I hate...."
                - Chomsky: study of language as way to study properties of the mind (cognition)
            * Led to the cognitive revolution!
- **Four Areas in Psycholinguistics**
    * **Linguistics**: 
        - The scientific study of human language
    * **Neurolinguistics**:
        - Emaphsis on brain chagnes during language use
    * **Sociolinguistics**: 
        - Emphasis on relationship between langauge and society/social behavior
    * **Computational Linguistics**:
        - Emphasis on computer models of natural language
- **Properties of Language**
    * **Communicative Property**
        - Language is use to communicate
        - Communication has **meaning**
        - Individuals send/recieve info with others who share language
            * e.g. others can understand internal stage ("I'm so...")
            * Requires a huge knowledge base
        - Must deal with ambiguity
            * Varition in sound & letters, differnt word meanings
            * Complex & multi-layered
                - Lots of ways to combine letters, word,sentences
                - All give different meaningsQ
            * Yet almost everyone becomes an expert
        - Still not ambiguity free (miscommunication happens)
    * **Arbitrarily Symbolic**
        - Arbitrary connection between the symbol (word) and concept
        - Words do not have to look or sound like what they describe
        - Principle of **Conventionality**
            * Meanings of words are determined by conventions
        - Princle of **Contrast**
            * Different words have different meanings
    * **Generative Property**
        - Using rules of language can create unlimited number of new utterences
    * **Dynamic Nature**
        - Evolution over time
        - Allows for creation of new words and ideas
        - Ex. Blog: online diary meant to be read by others
        - Ex. Spam has a new meaning -- unwanted email
            * Wiered meat in a can 
- **Structure of Language**
    * **Phonology**
        - **Phonetics**
            - Branch of linguistics focued on study of *speech sounds* and 
            - Their **representation in written symbols**
        * **Phone**
            - **Smallest unit** of **speech sound**
            - Symbolized in [ square brackets ]
            - Phone are physical events with 
                * *Distinct physical* & *perceptual properties*
        * **Phonemics**
            - Study of phonemes in a language
            - **Phoneme**
                * Smallest unit of speech sound ("phone") 
                    - Can make a difference in meaning between words in a language
                * **Doesn't necesssarily have meaning by itself**
                * Symbolized in backslashes: / /
                    - **Some phones are not phonemes**
                * **Some don't form distinctive meanings** in English language
                    - e.g.) Toungle clicking, cheek popping, gurgling
                    - /ph/ in "paper" and "put" (puff of air) vs. /p/ in "cup" or "lip" ( no puff)
                    -  **Allophones** = different variants of a sound that do not change the word meaning 
                        * (/p and /ph/ in english)
        * "Sound of a language"
            - Can include vowel and consoannt sounds
            - /s/ /f/ /t/ /l/ /ae/ phonemes represent sounds that distinguish utterances in English
                * "sit", "sat", "fit", "fat", "lit"
        * **Different languages** use **different sets of phonemes**
            - English has about 47 phonemes
            - Hawiian only has 11
            - Some African languages have 60
    - **Morphology**
        * Study of **Word Structure**
        * **Morpheme**
            - Smallest unit that denotes (has)
                * **Definable meaning** or 
                * **Gramtical function**
            - e.g.) 
                * "bus", "es", "ed", "tele", "hone", "truck", "s"
                * "Telephone"
                    - 2 morephemes ("tele", "phone")
                    - 7 phonemes (/t/, /e/, /l/, /e/, /f/, /o/, /n/)
    * **Content Morphemes**
        - Word that conveys the **core** of the **meaning**
        - e.g. attractive, happy
    * **Function Morphemes**
        - Add **nuances** to core meaning
        - e..g. **un**attractiveness, hapi**ness**
    * **Lexicon**
        - Entire set of morphemes for a language
        - Combining morephemes in lexicon pemits vocabulary of hundreds of thousands of words
        - Average 1st grader has 10,000 morphemes
        - Average 5th grader has 40,000 morphemes
        - Average adult has 80,000 morphemes
            * Combining morphemes in lexicon permits combination of hundreds of thousands of words
- **Syntax**
    * **Rules** used to **put words together** for a sentence
    * **Sentence** = Noun Phrase + Verb Phrase
    * **Noun Phrase** [NP]
        - Contains a subject/object and relevant descriptors
        - e.g.
            * **The freckeld boy** shouts
            * **She** kissed the man
    * **Verb Phrase** [VP] (i.e. predicate)
        - Contains at least one verb and objectss it acts upon 
            * (but not subject of the action)
        - e.g.
            * John **caught the ball**
            * Mary **gave John a frog**
- **Semantics**
    * The study of **meaning** in language
    * To best understand semantics, read the following sentences
        - The honest umbrella is in the garage.
        - The salty craftsman appreciates the quality of the product.
        - Cindy slept badly due to the sniffing dream.
    * Knowing that the sentences do not make sense reflects knowledge of semantics
- **Language Comphrension**
    * How do we **understand** what someone says?
    * Three **primary approaches/levels** to study:
        - **Speech perception**
            * Understanding **words**
            * **Coarticulatin** of phonemes vs. speech segmentation
            * Speech percetion as **ordinary vs. special**
                - Phonetic refinement/TRACE models, 
                - Phonemic-restoration effect vs. categorical perception of speech sounds (ba/da)
            * **Motor Theory**: 
                - Use visual info from speaker's vocal track/mouth movements (McGurk effect)
            * **Understanding meaning**: 
                - Words as semantic concepts (ideas)
                - Denotation versus Conaotation
        - **Gramatical Structure Appraoch**
            * Understanding sentence: grammer, syntax
        - **Discourse macro-level analysis**
- **Speech Perception**
    * Basics
        - We hear **sounds**
        - Put sounds together to form **words**
        - Comprehend the phrases of another's senetences
        - Understand the **ideas being conveyed**
        - Often done with *slurred*, *accented* or *delayed* speech input
    * In native language
        * Perceive 50 phonemes/second 
            - But **less than one phone/second for non-speech sounds**
        * Makes foreign language language diffucult to understand!
            - All words blend together
        * Why is this? 
            - **Phonemes overlap!**
    * **Coarticulation**
        - Phonemes overlap in time in normal speech
        - **Speech sound** (physical engery) is **contingous**
        - One or more phonemes begin while other are still being produced
        - Usually **no breaks between words** either
        - **American Sign Language** (ASL): 
            * Skilled signers show coarticulation of 
            * Hand shape, movement and position
        - Yet coarticulation does not impair speech perception
    * **Speech Segmentation**
        - Perception of distinct phonemes and words from the continous flow of the speech signal
        - "Mice eat oats and little lambs eat ivy"
- **Speech Perception is "Ordinary"**
    * Recall template-matching and feature-detection theories of perception
    * **Phonetic** Refinement Theory & **TRACE** model
        - **Analyze auditory sensations** into **components** for patterns 
            * **Match to prototype or template**
        – Then go to **higher level processing** using **context** to help
            * **Don't necesarilly need the first phoneme** to **decode a word**
            * Not necesarily direct correspondence between the acoustic stimuli and the speech sound we hear (perceive)
            * Can complete (restore) the full picture using **Gestalt-like/closure processes**
            * **No "special"** extra processes needed for **speech perception**
                - Its ordinary, **same processas percieving non-speech sounds**
- Alternative View: **Speech Perception is "Special"**
    * Evidence of **Cateogrical Perception**
        - **Continous** dimension of speech sounds perecieved as **discrete** categories of speech sounds
        - Sudden break between categories
        - No discrimnination within categories
    * **Voice Onset Time** (VOT)
        - Time between begining of pronunciation of the word and onset of the vibration of the vocal chords
        - "ba" you vocal chords vibrate right from the start
        - "pa" your vocal chords do not vibrate until after a short delay
        - The VOT can be varied across a *continous* range (not necessarily categorical)
    * **Categorial Perception Evidence**
        - The sounds "ba" and "pa can differ on the **continous dimeous of VOT**
        - Listeners can differntiate between /p/ and /b/
            * ie. discriminate between phoneme categories
        - But not good at distinguishing between differnt types of /p/ sounds
            * ie. within categories
        - Categorical perception does not apply to non-speech sounds
            * eg. bell tones, we perceive continous range of pitches
        - Supports idea that specialized processes are bgin used in speech perception
    * **McGurk Effect**
        - Lip movements to one sound "ba"
        - Soundtrakc indicates "da"
        - What do you hear?
        - McGurk & MacDonald (1976) found that people percieve a "compramised" sound "tha"
- **Semantics**
    * **Denotation**
        - **Defintion** of **word's meaning**
    * **Connotation**
        - **Additional nuances** of **word meaning**
        - (emoitional, social, cultural)
    * Consider these examples
        - Bachelorette vs. Spinster
        - Hungry vs. Starving
- **Syntax**
    * The **grammatical arrangement** of words into a **sentence or phrase**
    * **Descriptive Grammar**
        - Describe the strucutres, function, and relatinships of words in language
    * **Prescriptive Grammar**
        - The "correct" way to structure sentence
    *  **Syntactical Priming**
        * Exposure to a **particular syntatic sturcutre** leads speakers to **reproduce same sturcture** in subsequent speech
        * Considered a priming phenonmenon
            - Prime creates an implicit procedural memory that shapes how you speak
        * e.x
            - THe mouse is being chased by the cat vs.
            - The cat is chasing the mouse
    * **Other Evidence for Power of Syntax**
        - **Speech Errors**
            - Tend to remain syntax-appropriate
                * Switch nouns for nouns
                * Verbs for verbs
                * Prepositions for prepositions
        - **Sample Error**
            * The butter drawers are in the knife
- **Phrase Structure Grammars**
    * Words aren't the only part of language that **convey meaning**
    * So does **linguistic structure**
        - e.g.: the main hunted the lion vs. the lion hunted the man
    * **Syntax** = systematic way words can be meaningfully combined
    * **Psycholinguists** use phrase-structure rules
        * Rules goverining sequence of words in sentences based on their syntatical category
            - (noun, verb, adjectives, etc.)
        * Some labels/examples
            - PS 1 S = sentecen = NP + VP
            - PS 2 NP = noun phrase = det + (adj) + N
                * The hungry lion
            - PS 3 VP = verb phrase = v + NP
                * ...chased the drunk man
- **Syntax and Tree Diagrams**
    * Sentence have a **hierarchal structure**
        - Whole sentence made of smaller parts (NP & VP)
        - Each comprised of yet smaller parts
    * **Tree diagrams** used to **reveal relationships** between and within phrases
        - Syntatical classes w/in the phrase structures of sentence
        - Shows **sentences aren't just sequential chains** of words strung together
            * Follow a hierachial structure of embedded phrases
        - So phrase structure grammar (tree structures) help show syntactical relationships between phrases
            * But are there also deeper syntax realtionships beteween sentences
    * Show our linguistic sophistication and challenges, ambigiouites
        - The shy girl hid the broken cup
- **Chompsky's Transformational Grammar**
    * Rules for mapping tree structures onto other structures (Wasow 1989)
    * Propositions can be represnted in diffent ways with same meaning:
        - 1. Susie greedily ate the crocidile
        - 2. The crocodile was eaten greedily by Susie
        - 3. The crocodile greedilya ate Susie
        - 4. Sudies was eaten greedily by the grocodile
    * **Phrase structure grammar** 
        - Fails to show relation between 1 & 2 and between 3 & 4 
        - Yet each pair only differs in voice (active/passive) and not meaning
        - Also phrase sturcture is same for 1&3 and 2&4 but mreaning is different
    * **Chomsky's Transformational Grammar Rules**
        - Guide how underlying propositons can be rearranged 
            * (ie. tranformation of sentence elemnets) to form various phrase structures
        - **"Deep Structure"**
            * Transofrmation rules create underlying syntax sturcture 
            * Links phrase structures (maps tree structrures onto other tree structures)
        - **"Surface Structure"** 
            * Actual **phrase structures**, which may be determined by transofrmation rules
            * Note: Deep structures does not refer to a deeper meaning of a sentence
            * Rather a deeper **syntatical structure**, which can have **implicaitons for meaning**
            * **Mental Lexicon**: *more* than just morphemes (semnatics); also **syntax info**
            * Category (e.g., noon/verb) allowed context (e.g. as subject/object), idiosyncratic rules:
                - eg. irregular verbs: "fall", "spread": don't add the standard "ed" for past tense
    * **Problem with Transofmraiton Grammar**
        - When converting deeper structure to surface sturcture, **the number** of transformation rules applied should affect **how long** it **takes to process a sentence*8
        - Experiments do not consistently show that this is true
- **Lexical Functional Grammar**: **Thematic Rules**
    * Language comprehension models also based heavily on syntax like Chomsky's 
    * Shows how link/bridge our lexical with syntax
    * **Thematic Roles** = ways in which lexical items can be used in communication
        - Ex. "susie gave Katrina the cookies from her lunchbox."
        - Agent = doer of action (can fill subject noun syntactic slot) Susie
        - Patient = direct recicpient (can fill direct object slot) cookies
        - Beneficiary = indirect recipient (can fill indirec tobject slot) Katrina
        - Instrument = means by which action is implemented (verb) gave
        - Location = place where action occurs [unspecified; e.g., "at school]
        - Source = where the aciton originated lunchbox
        - Goal = where the action is goind [unspecified; e.g., "to the classroom"]
    * **Constiuent Strcuture**
        - Similar to phrase structure
    * **Functional Structure**
        - All the information needed for semantic interpreation
        - (subj, obj, past tense information)
    * **BLANK** Entries
        - The form of the word **and** the kinds of senetences into which they fit (Thematic Roles)
            * Underlying semantic structure for "kiss"
                - kiss: (agent/doer, patient/recipient)
                    * One can do the kissing (subject as agent), or...
                    * One can be kissed (subject as patient)
            * Forms of the word:
                - kiss: agent = subject: patient = object
                - (be) kissed : agent = object: patient = subject
- Language **Acquisition**
    * **Cooing**
        - First stage in infants' oral expressions that explores theproduction of (mostly) vowel sounds.
        - Is a **Universal** Stage
            * Indistinguishable among infants
            * (Same among hearing, deaf, different countries, and langauges)
        - Is an **Important** Stage
            * Some with cerebral palsy have delayed cooing onset
            * Delayed cooing onset is associated with later language diffuculties (Otapowicz et al. 2005)
        - Hearing infants during cooing stage can distinguish all **phones**
            * Not just phonemes, but even phones that carry no meaning for them
                - **Phone** = Smallest unit of speech sound (e.g., /p/ in "put")
                - **Allophones** = Phone variants (e.g., /p/ in "put" vs. /ph/ in "cup")
                - **Phonemes** = Meaningfully distinct allophones for a given language
                    * e.g. /k/ in "cat" vs. /v/ in "vat" in English
        - Universal **stage** in ability to discriminate **phones** - phonemic phones (those that aren't meaningfuly to our language by 6 months
        - Eimas (1985)
            * Japaneese and American Infants
            * Hear /l/ and /r/ sounds
            * Both groups can distinguish
            * At age 1, Japaneese children can no longer distinguish. (No need to in Japaneese language)
        - Werker (1994)
            * Indian children in English vs. Hindi speaking homes
            * /t/ phonemes differ in Hindi but not English
            * In English-only spekaing homes, infants distinguish such Hini-only phonemes w/ 95% accuracy at 6-8 moths, only 20% at 10-12 months.
    * **Babbling**
        - Infant's preferential production of **phonemes** of their own language (vowels & consonants)
        - Begins roughly around **BLANK** months of age
        - Stage at which hearing infants of differnt countries start to **differentiate** in communicative sounds
        - Appearnce of similar/identical syllables first
            * E.g. "Ba ba ba", "Ma ma ma"
            * By late babling stage: non-repeated phonemes
        - Ability to percieve & produce non-ponemic phones continues to recede
        - **BLANK** infants no longer vocalize at babbling stage
    * **First Words**... and beyond
        - Usually a few words produced by 1st birthday
        - **Holophrases**: one-word utterences
            * USually familair objects (e.g., Dada, Blankie, Shoe, Book)
            * Convey intentions, desires, demands
                - Driven by semantic but not syntactic concerns -- the need to communicate
            * By 18 months, vocabulary of 3 to 100 words
        - **Telegraphic** speech (18-24 month)
            * 2 or 3 word utterences, follow rudimentary syntax structure
            * Can be longer but omit some function morphemes
            * Sound more like elegrams than conversations
            * E.g., "want juice", "daddy sit"
        - Vocabulary grows rapidly: 300 words by age 2, 1000 by age 3
        - By age 4: basic adult sentence structure
        - By age 10: language structure and complexity is fundamentally same as adults
        - Adolescnece: increase in complex syntax; vocabulary increases at declining rate
    * **Children Speech Errors**
        - **Overextension Error**
            * Erroneously extending meaning of a word in existing lexicon to voer ideas for which a nw word is lacking:
                - "Doggie" means all animals
                - "Blankie" means all soft things
            * Why? 
                - **Feature Hypotheseis** 
                    * (Clark, 1973)
                    * Reflects how infant's defintions include too few features
                    * Doggie = anything with 4 legs
                - **Functional Hypothese**
                    * (Nelson, 1973)
                    * Reflects confusion of functions oof object (blankie = anything that keeps me warm)
            * OVerexntions coudl reflect both mechanisms
        - **BLANK** Errors
            * Ball is used only when ball is under bed
            * Kitty refers only to family pet
- **Nature versus Nurture**
    * **Nature** Support
        - **Language Acquisition Device** (LAD; Chomsky (1965))
            * Biologically innate mechanism that faicilitate language acquisition
        - Proposes humans are preconfigured / always ready to learn language
        - Support:
            * Special Nature of phoneme processing (vs. auditory procesing of non-speech sounds)
            * All children can acquire langate at same rate
                - Same rate in deaf children acquiring sign language
            * Ability to detect words
            * Ability to segment spoken sentences into words
                - (even for artificial languages; even 6 month-olds)
            * All children acquire same skills around the same time
            * Eric Lennenberg's 1967 **Biological Foundation of Language** book:
                - **Critical Period Hypothesis**: Age 3-5 is time of rapid development opportunity, outside of which human language will not develop
                    * Chomsky agreed with this hypothesis
    * **Nurture** Support
        - Enviroment is necessary during **acquisition period** of language development
            * vs. Chomsky & Lennenberge: we aren't taught language, but instead are gentically programmed to acquire it.
        - American sign language proficiency is influenced by what age language is acquired
        - Case studies of linguistily isolated children
            * Genie Wiley, the feral "Wild Child"
                - Lived in LA apt with controlling father (who judged her to be retarded), blind mother, and brother
                - Kept in a cage with a chicken wire lid and strapped to a potty chair in diapers all day for 13 years before discovered by authorities in 1970.
                - Malnourished (size of 6 year old), no language skills
                - Developed better nonverbal communication but only telegraphic (2-3 word) speech
                    * "potty chair", "applesauce buy store"
            * Critical Period debate: Are limits in feral child language development due to lack of language nurturing, or other mental or physical impacts of neglect/abuse
    * Both **Nature AND Nurture**
        - **Hypothesis Testing View**
            * Children create hypotheses about patterns based on their inherited skill for language acquisition (nature)
            * Children then test those hypothesis in enviroment (nurture)
            * They selectivly attend to patterns charactering the native language. e.g.,
                - Changes in forms of words
                - Morpheme inflections, esp. sufixes (e.g., "-ed" and "-s") that signal change in meaning
                - Sequences of morphemes (affixes, roots) and words in sentences
            * Learn to avoid exceptions
        - Support for **Hypothesis Testing View**
            * **Overregularization**: using and even over-applying language rules
                - Regular verb inflections to irregular verbs: "I **goed** outside"
                - Regular noun inflections to irregular nouns: "Daddy talked to the **mans**"
            * **Language Productivity**
                - Show understaind of rules in creatinv novel utterences
        - **Imitation**
            * Says children do exactly what they see others do
            * Not sufficient to explain how they learn all nuanaces
        - **Modeling**
            * Children **loosely** imitate what they hear
            * Adults amke language intersting and comprehensible
            * Children-Directed Speech (i.e. "motherese")
                - Simpler sentence sstructures, use of diminutives & dramatic inflection
                - "Doggie outside?" "See birdie!" "Get ducky?" "Babby come to mommy!"
- **Animal Language Research**
    * Advantage to styding languages in animals
    * Simpler BLANK of behavior than humans
    * Fewer BLANK constraints
        - Though still need ethics committee approval
    * BLANK time subjects
        - Readily available (never any "no-shows")
        - Complete control of enviroment
    * BLANK analysis
        - BLANk and developmental basis of language
    * Diffentiate which skills are BLANK human
        - Rene Descartes: language is what makes human unique
    * Many animals communicate
        - BLANk = exchange of thoughts and feelings
            * Means: verbal, nonverbal (gestures, etc)
            * e.g. chimp cry to indicate being attacked
            * BUT.
        - **Language** = an organized way of combining words to communicate
            * Uniquely developed in humans
            * Large repertoire, productive (new utterences), large & sophisticated structure, use of arbitrary symbols, spontanously acquired
    * Grey Parrots: Irene Ppperberg & Alex
        - Could produce more than 200 words
        - Express complex concepts like present/absent
        - Novel combinations of words to form new ways of expressing conceps
        - What color is corn?
            * Alex's answer **yellow**
        - What's the same?
            * Alex's answer **color**
        - Labels for more than 35 objects (e.g. paper, key, wood, cork...)
        - Functional use of No
        - Phrases such as **I want X, Wanna go Y** where X and Y are appropriate words
        - Labels for 7 colors
        - Can identify number of items up to 6
        - Alex can use vocabulary to proficeintly identify, request, refuse, categorize, and quantify more than 100 diffent objects
    * **Washoe**
        - Previous attemps to teach chimpanzees **verbal** language failed
        - Gardner (1966) taught sign language to femal chimp named "Washoe"
        - Criteron for reliability for each of Washoe's signs:
            * Seen by atleast 3 observers on 3 different occasions
            * Then at least 15 days in a row
        - Washoe was able to use the word "more" appropriatly in diffent contexts
        - First words were "more tickling'
        - Transferred the sign **dog** to the sound of barking by an unseen dog
        - Acquired around 250 words in ASL
        - Washoe the "speaking chimp" died 11/07 at age 42
        - Linguist Noam Chomsky and Steven Pinker raised doubts, claiming:
            * Language is **exclusive** to humans
            * Homo sapiens evolved neural device after evolutional split from other primates
            * Non-human primates learn simple acts to get rewards, this isn't true language
    * **Beyond Washoe...**
        - Bodamer, Fouts, Fouts, & Jensvold (1994)
            * Studied **private signing** by chimpanzees
            * Found priave signing is robust
        - Gardner & Gardner (Loulis)
            * Washoe adopted an infant chimp named **Loulis**
            * No human signed in front of infant chimp
            * Loulis still managed to learn over 50 signs from other chimpanzees
            * No active teaching, rather Loulis just learned through observation among other signing chimps
        - **"Nim Chimpsky"** (Terrace 1979)
            * Used rigorous method to train Nim ASL, but...
            * Skeptical of the reported success of the chimpanzess like Washoe
            * Compared their behavior to that of pigeons who are taught to peck diffent colors in a certain order
            * Like Pinker, believed that apes only used to **get rewards** from trainers
            * Nim learned signs for many words: dirty, sleep, bite, and angry (up to 125 words), but...
                - Only pragmatic (to achieve outcome); no expression of meaning, ideas
            * No grammar/syntax organization
                - Alternated signing: "Give Nim banana", "Banna give Nim", "Banna Nim give"
            * Repitition only. No creation of word phrases
            * After the xperiments wer eover, and Nim was retired, he continued to sign.
            * His most-used signs were drink, gum, bannan, and more
            * Are all chimps like pigeons when it comes to langauge, or was it just Nim?
            * Nurture effect? Lived first 10 months in a lab before increased human contact
            * **Pygmy chimps** show creative combination of visual symbols of a learned sign language and understand some spoken language (Savage-Rumbaugh et al. 1986)
            * Still not as **sponatnously acquired** like human language; requires intensive systematic instruction
    * **Koko** (Age 35)
        - Peny Patterson raising lowland gorilla Koko since 1972
        - Taught Koko sign language
        - Has a greater vocabulary than Nim
        - Uses more words per utterances
        - Patterson & Linden (1981)
            * Koko uses grammar,  is creative and spotanous in her language, understands and uses humor
        - Koko now has vocabulary of over 1000 signs, and understands even more spoken english
        - Koko invented her own new compound signs
            * e.g. finger-bracelet for ring
    * Animal vs. Human Language
        - Human language facility far exceeds even our closest non-human relatives
            * Chimps over BLANK% gentically idnetical to us
        - Chomsky: "If an animal had a capacity as biologically advantageous as language but somehow hadn't used it until now, it would be an evolutionary miracle, like finding an island of humans who could be taught to fly"

- Animal Language Research
    * Simpler models of behavior than humans
    * Fewer ethical constraints
        - Thought sitll need ethics committee approval
    * Full time subjects
        - Ready avialable (new any "no shows')
        - Complete control of enviroment
    * Comparitive analysis
- "Washoe" the Chimp

    * Washoe was able to use word "more" appropriatly in differnt contexts
    * First words were "mor tickling"
    * Transfered sign dog to the sound of barking by an unseen dog
    * Acquired around 250 words in ASL
    * Washoe the speaking chimp died 11/07 at age 42.
    * Chomsky and Piker raised doubts
        - Language is unique to humans
        - Hmo sapients evolved neural device after evolutionary split from other primates
- Beyond Washoe
    * Bodamer, Fouts, Fouts, & Jensvold (1994)
        - Stuedied private signing by chimpanzees
        - Found private signing is robust
    * Garder & Garder (1989)
        - Washoe adopted an infant chimp named Loulis
        - No humans signed in front of infant chimp
        - Loulis still manged to learn over 50 signs from other chimpanzees
        - No active teaching, rather Loulis just learned
- Nim Chimpsky (Terrace)
    * Used reigious method to train Nim ASL, but..
    * Skeptical fo the reported success of the chimpanzees like Washoe
    * Compared their behavior to that of pigeons who are
    * Nim learned signs for many words: dirty, sleep, biute, and angry (up to 125 words), but...
    * Only prgamatic (to eachireve outcome); not expression of thughts, ideas
    * No greammar/syntax organization
        - Alternated sgining "Give Nim banana", "banana give nIm" "banana nim give"
    * Repition only. No creation of new phrases
    * His most used signes were drink, gum, banana, and more
    * are all chimps like pigeons when it comes to language, or was it just Nim?
    * Nuture effects? Lived first 10 months in a lab before increased human contact
    * Pygmy chimps show created combination of visual symbols of a leanred sign language and understand some spoken language
- Koko (Gorilla, Age 35)
    * Penny Patterson raising lowland gorilla since 1972
    * Taught Koko sign lanaguage
    * Has greater voculatry than Nim
    * Uses more words per utterence
    * Patterson & Liden (1981)
        - Koko uses structure, is creatuive, and spontnous in her lenavues
        - Understnad and uses humor
    * Koko now have vocab of over 1000 signs, and understands even more spoken english
- Animal vs. Human langauge
    * Human language facility far exceeds even our closest non-human relatives
        - Chimps: over 95% gentically identical to us
        - Chip "lagnuage" repetoire is small,er less ophisticated in structure, spotenousely acquired, generative
        - And, they still use flip phones
    * Chomsky suggest skepticism:
        - If animal had capaticy biologically advcantgeous as language nbut somehow hand' used it until now, it would be an evolutionarly miralce, like finding an island of humand who could be taugft to fly
