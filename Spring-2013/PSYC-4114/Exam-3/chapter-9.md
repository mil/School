Chapter 9 - Language
====================
- Nature and Acquisition
- **Phonology**
    * **Phonetics**
        - Branch of linguistics focued on study of *speech sounds* and 
        - Their reperesnation in written symbols
    * **Phone**
        - Smallest unit of speech sound
        - Symbolized in [ square brackets ]
        - Phone are physical events with *distinct physical* & *perceptual properties*
    * **Phonemics**
        - Study of phonemes in a language
        - **Phoneme**
            * Smallest unit of speech sound ("phone") 
                - Can make a difference in meaning between words in a language
            * Doesn't necesssarily have meaning by itself
            * Symbolized in backslashes: / /
                - Some phones are **not** phonemes 
            * Some don't form distinctive meanings in English language
                - e.g.) Toungle clicking, cheek popping, gurgling
                - /ph/ in "paper" and "put" (puff of air) vs. /p/ in "cup" or "lip" ( no puff)
                -  **Allophones** = different variants of a soudn that do not change the word meaning
    * "Sound of a language"
        - Can include vowel and consoannt sounds
        - /s/ /f/ /t/ /l/ /ae/ phonemes represent sounds that distinguish utterances in English
            * "sit", "sat", "fit", "fat", "lit"
    * Different languages use different set of phonemes
        - English has about 47 phonemes, Hawiian only has 11, some African languages have 60
- **Morphology**
    * Study of **word structure**
    * **Morpheme**
        - Smallest unit that denotes (has) a 
            * **Definable meaning** or 
            * **Gramtical function**
        - e.g.) 
            * "bus", "es", "ed", "tele", "hone", "truck", "s"
            * "Telephone"
                - 2 morephemes ("tele", "phone")
                - 7 phonemes (/t/, /e/, /l/, /e/, /f/, /o/, /n/)
    * **Content Morphemes**
        - Word that conveys the *core* of the meaning
        - e.g. attractive, happy
    * **Function Morphemes**
        - Add **nuances** to core meaning
        - e..g. **un**attractiveness, hapi**ness**
    * Lexicon
        - Entire se tof morphemes for a languag
        - Combining morephemes in lexicon pemits **vocabulary&& of hundreds of thousands of words
- **Syntax**
    * **Rules** used to **put words together** for a sentence
    * **Sentence** = Noun Phrase + Verb Phrase
    * Nound Phrase [NP]
        - Contains a subject/object and relevant descriptors
        - e.g.
            * The freckeld boy shouts
            * She kissed the man
    * Verb Phrase [VP] (i.e. predicate)
        - Contains at least one verb and objects it acts upon (but not subject of the action)
        - e.g.
            * John **caught** **the ball**
            * Mary **gave** **John a frog**
- **Semantics**
    * The study of **meaning** in language
    * To best understand semantics, read the following sentences
        - The honest umbrella is in the garage.
        - The salty craftsman appreciates the quality of the product.
        - Cindy slept badly due to the sniffing dream.
    * Knowing that the sentences do not make sense reflects knowledge of semantics
- Language Comphresion
    * How do we **understand** what someone says?
    * Three primary approaches/levels to study:
        - **Speech perception**
            * Understanding words
            * Coarticulatin of phonemes vs. speech segmentation
            * Speech percetion as ordinary vs. special
                - Phonetic refinement/TRACE models, phonemic-restoration effect cs. categorical perceiotn of speech sounds (ba/da)
            * Motor Theory: use visual info from speaker's vocal track/mouth movements (McGurk effect)
            * Understanding meaning: words as semantic concepts (ideas)
                - Denotation
                - Conaotation
        - **Gramatical Strcture Appraoch**
            * understanding senetance: grammer, syntax
        - **Discourse macro-level analysis
- Speech Perception
    * Basics
        - We hear **sounds**
        - Put sounds together to form **words**
        - Comprehend the phrases of another's senetences
        - Understand the ideas being conveyed
        - Often done with *slurred*, *accented* or *delayed* speech input
    * In native language = perceive 50 phonemes/second but less than one phone/second for non-speech sounds.
        * Makes forigh language diffucult to understand!
        * All words blend together
        * Why is this? Phonemes overlap
    * Coarticulation
        - Phonemes overlap in time in normal speech
        - Speech sound (physical engery) is contingous
        - One or more phonemes begin while other are still being produced
        - Usually no breaks between words either
        - American Sign Language (ASL): Skilled signers show coarticulation of hand shape, movement and position
        - Yet coarticulation odes not impair speech perception
    * Speech Segmentation
        - Perception of distinct phonemes and words from the continous flow of the speech signal
        - "Mice eat oats and little lambs eat ivy"
- **Speech Perception is Ordinary**
    * Recall remplate matching and feature-deteciton theories of perception
    * **Phonetic** Refinement Theory & **TRACE** model
        - Analyze auditory sensations into components for patterns 
        - Match to prototype or template
        – Then go to higher level processing using **context** to help
            * Don't necesarilly need the first phoneme to decode a word
            * Not necesarily direct correspondence between the acoustic stimuli and the speech sound we hear (perceive)
            * Can complete (restore) the full picture using Gestalt-like/closure processes
            * No "special" extra processes needed for speech perception
                - Its ordinary, sanme processas percieving non-speech sounds
- Alternative View: **Speech Perception is "Special"**
    * Evidnece of **cateogrical perception**
        - THe acutal **continous** dimension of speech sounds is perecieved as **discrete** categories
        - Sudden break between categories
        - No discrimnination within categories
    * Vioce Onset Time (VOT)
        - The time between the begining of the pronunciation of the word and the onset of the vibration of the vocla chords
        - "ba" you vocal chords vibrate right from the start
        - "pa" your vocal chords do not vibrate until after a short delay
        - The VOT can be varied across a *continous* range (not necessarily categorical)
- McGurk
    * Pepole percieve a "compramised" sound "tha"
- Semantics
    * Denotation
        - Defintion of word's meaning
    * Connotation
        - Additional nuances of word meaning
        - (emoitional, social, cultural)
    * Consider these examples
        - Bachelorette vs. Spinster
        - Hungry vs. Starving
- Syntax
    * The grammatical arrangment of words into a sentence or phrase
    * Descriptive Grammar
        - Describe the strucutre,s function, and relatinships of words in language
    * Prescriptive Grammar
        - The "correct" way to structure sentence
-  Syntactical Priming
    * Exposure to a particular syntatic sturcutre leads speakers to reproduce the smae sturcture in subsequent speech
    * Considered a priming phenonmenon
        - Prime creates an implicit procedural emmory that shpaes how you 
    * e.x
        - THe mouse is being chased by the cat vs.
        - The cat is chasing the mouse
- Other Evidence for Power of Syntax
    * Speech Errors
        - Tend to remain syntax-appropriate
            * Switch nouns for nouns
            * Verbs for verbs
            * Prepositions for prepositions
    - Sample  Error
        * The butter drawers are in the knife
- Phrase structure Grammars
    * Words aren't the only part of language that convey meaning
    * So does linguistic sturcture
        - e.g. - the main hunted the lion vs. the lion hunted hte man
    * syntax = systematic way words can be meaninfully combined
    * Pyscholinguists use phrase-structure rules
        * Rules goverining the sequence of words in sentences based on their syntatical category
            - (noun, verb, adjectives, etc.)
        * Some labels/examples
            - PS 1 S = sentecen = NP + VP
            - PS 2 NP = noun phrase = det + (adj) + N
                * The hungry lion
            - PS 3 VP = verb phrase = v + NP
                * ...chased the drunk man
- Syntax and Tree Diagrams
    * Sentence have a heierarchial structure, with a whole sentence made of smaller parts (NP & VP), 
        - each comprised of yet smaller partsb
    * Tree diagrams ar eused to reveal realtionships between and within phrases
        - Syntatical classes w/in the phrase sturcuteres of sentence
        - Shows sentences aren't just sequential chaings of words strung together
            * Follow a hierachial structure of embeeded phrases
    * So phrase structure grammaer (tree sturcutres) help show syntactical relationships between phrases
    * but are there also deeper syntax realtionships beteween sentences
- Chompsky's Transformational Grammar
    * Rules for mapping tree structures onto other sturctures (wasow 1989)
    * Phrase sturcture grammar fails to show relation between 1 & 2 and between 3 & 4 yet each pair only differs in voice (acitve/passive) and not meaning
    * Chomksys's Transofmraitonl Grammar Rules
        - Guide how underlying propositons can be rearranged (ie. tranformation of sentence elemnets) to form various phrase structures
        - "DEeep Structure" = transofrmation rules creates underlying syntax sturcture that links phrase structures (maps tree structrures onto other tree structures)
        - "Surface Structure" = Actual phrase structures, which may be determined by transofrmation rules
            * Note: Deep strcutures does not refer to a deeper meaning of a sentence
            * Rather a dpeeper syntatical structure, which can have implicaitons for meaning
            * Mental lexicon: more than just morphemes (semnatics); also syntax info
                - .eg. irregular verbs: "fall", "spread": don't add the standard "ed" for past tense
    * Problem with Transofmraiton Grammar
        - When converting deeper structure to surface sturcture, the number of transofrmation rules applied should affect how long it takes to process a sentence
        - Experiemnts do not consistently show that this is true
- Lexical Functional Grammar: **Thematic Rules**
    * Language comprehension models also based heavily on syntax like Chomsky's 
    * Shoe how link/bridge our lexical with syntax
    * **Thematic Roles** = ways in which lexcial items can be used in communication
        - Ex. "susie gave Katrina the cookies from her lunchbox."
        - Agent = doer of action (can fill subject noun syntactic slot) Susie
        - Patient = direct recicpient (can fill direct object slot) cookies

Psycholiguistics
================
- The psychological study of language including metnal processes involved
- Storage and other ocgnitive processes
    * How are perception, attention * emmory processes involved in language production, comprhrenehsion and acquisition?
- Comprehenesion
    * How do we undetsnad speokn and written language?
    * How do we process language sounds?
    * Understand words, sentences, stories
        - Expressesd in writing, speech, sign language
    * How do we converse with one another?
- Proudciton
    * Physical speech production
    * Mental processes in creating speech
- Acquisition
    * How do we acquire language?
- Language
    * An organized, rule-governed way to communicate using a finite set of sounds and symbols to express an infinite range of information
        - Feelings, thoughts, ideas, experiences
        - INvolves both receptive (comprhension) and expressive (production, verbal fluency) abilities
    * UNique to humans
        - While non-human primates and uuse language in some similar ways, most animal communication lacks the unique properties of human lanugage
    * Involves learned (enviroment) but also innate (inherited) components
    * Learned (enviroment) but also innate (inherited) components..
