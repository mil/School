Chapter 11 - Problem Solving
============================
- Problem Solving 
    * An effort to overcome obstacles obstructing the path to a solution (Reed, 200)
    * **Initial State**
        - Current situation
        - Define the Problem
    * **Goal State**
        - Desierd Objective
    * **Obstacles**
        - Choices made about limitations
        - Strategy choices
        - Limited resources
- Problem Solving Cycle
    * Steps to know....
    * Identify Problem
    * Define Problem
    * Select Strategy
    * Organize Info
    * Allocate Resources
    * Monitor Solving
    * Evaluate Success
- **Problem Identification**
    * **Identify situation** as **problematic**
        - **Recognizing** that you have a problem to solve
    * Sound odd, but often a diffucult step. May fail to recognize:
        - That we have a problem
            * Not always presented, must be discovered
            * I've developed a drinking problem
        - That we have a goal
            * To miss the oncoming car
        - That the path is obstructed
            * Can't buy that new car, not enough $
        - That the solution we have in mind won't work
            * Waiting until the day before its due to write a term paper
- **Problem Definition and Representation**
    * Define the **nature of the problem**
        - Mental reprensation of: 
            * Initual state, goal state, allowable operatores (move), constraints
    * Must accurately define a problem to solve it
    * Not always easy
        - Depends in part on one's **knowledge**
        - Pior knowledge can **help or hinder**
        - Requries *determing what information is relevant vs. irrelevant*
    * Often pay attention to irrelevant information
        - E.g. the doorman/exclusive club problem: counting letters vs. dividing #s
- **Strategy Formation**
    * Select a strategy to solve the problem
    * Analysis
        - **Brekaing into sub goals**
        - Study for exam sub goals
            * Read textbook & class notes
            * Idnetify most relevant topics
            * Create study Q/A note cards
    * **Divergent thinking**
        - Generate multiple solutions to problem
        - **Brainstorm all options**
        - Will revisit when we discuss creativity
    * **Convergent thinking**
        - **Narrow down** to best answer
        - After allowing some divergent thinking
- **Organization of Information**
    * **Organizing info** aids problem solving
    * Might organize visually using
        - Symbols
        - Matrixes
        - Diagrams
- **Final Steps**
    * **Resources Allocation**
        - How much time, 
        - Effort, $, 
        - How much Should I put into this problem
    * **Monitoring**
        - Am I on track as I proceed to solve this problem?
    * **Evaluation**
        - Did I solve the problem correctly?
- **Types of Problems**
    * **Well structured** problems
        - Have a clearn goal & path (formula) to the solution
        - Math problems, anagrams, most school tests (history, geography, etc.) 
            * Often **content-specific**
        - E.g. find the area of a prallelogram
        - Cognitive Psychology "Move Problems"
            * Requires specific series of moves (tranformations) forom initual to goal (end) state
            * Tower of Hanoi/London: move all discs to right in fewest number of moves
        - Error Types: 
            * inadvertent move backward, 
            * illegal moves, 
            * getting stuck (not sure what to do next, may have to move backward first)
    * **Ill Structured Problems**
        - Problem space not well defined; 
        - No easy solution path to infer, 
        - May be more than one correct solution
            * Two strings problem (tie together 2 suspended strings - can't reach both)
            * How to find an apartment, house
            * What gifts to buy, what to put on your wish list
            * Write a term paper, book
            * Who to sleect as friends, life partner
- **Methods** for **Studying Problem Solving**
    * **Error analysis** or **reaction time**
        - Global measure of performance
    * **Verbal protocols**
        - Pariticpants speak their thoughts out loud while solving problems
        - Strategies beocme evident in protocols
    * **Computer Simulations**
        - Create moedels that can recreate human data
- **Newell and Simon** (1972)
    * **Problem Space**
        - All possible actions (Strageies) that can be applied to a problem to geth to the solution
    * Consists of **states and operators**
        - **States** 
            * **Represnt the problem**
            * **Intial State** - given information & prior knowledge
            * **Goal State** - desired *outcome* / solution
        - **Operators**
            * Transform one state to another state
            * Permitted or selected moves
    * Created **General Problem Solver** (GPS)
        - Discussed further in Ch13 Artificial Intelligence
        - Based on **Verbal protocol**
        - Reproduced on computer using a **production rule system** to create  a **simlar represntation** of problem
            * Used a means-ends analysis heuristic
            * Used a means-end analysis heuristic
- **Strategies to Solve Problems**
    * **Algorithm**
        - Systematic proceudre garunteed (if correctly specified ) to find a solution
        - **Sequence of operations** in a problem space
        - Repeated over and over until condition is satisfied
        - Words well on computers
            * **Requires high processing speed**
            * Compute **nuemrous possible combinations**
        - Humans: limited processing speed, fewer operations at once (working memory)
    * **Heuristic**
        - Useful rule of thumb based one experience
        - **"Mental shortcuts"**
            * Infomration, intuitive, speculative stragies that sometimes work
        - Efficient: **less burden** on our **limited-capacity working memory**
        - **Does not garuntee correct solution**
- **Hueristics**
    * **Means-end Analysis**
        - Compare current state with goal and choose an action to bring you closer to the goal
            * Try to minimize the distance (difference reduction)
        - Break problem down into **smaller goals**
        - May now work if correct subgoals cannot be identified
    * **Working Forward**
        - Start at initial state
        - Work to goal state
        - Ex.
            * Math problems
            * (2 + 5) / (5 * 1)
            * Complete m at inside parenthesis first, then divide the quantities to get to solution
    * **Working Backwards**
        - Figure out last step needed to reach your gola
        - Then the next to last step, and so on
        - Ex.
            * Lost keys
            * Try to remebr the last time you used them and work backwards
        - Work backwards from goal state
    * **Generate and Test**
        - Trial and error strategy
        - Create possibilities, **test them** and discard the ones that are incorrect
            * Your car will not start
            * Wait a moment and try again, may be flooded
            * Check to see if there is gas, if no scucess
            * Check to see if the battery is charged... etc
        - This may not be the most efficient strategy
    * **Transformation Problem**
        - Hobbits and Orcs
            * Three hobbits and three orcs come to a river and find a boat that holds two.
            * If the Orcs ever outnumber the hobbits on eithe rbank, the hobbits will be eaten
            * How do you get them all to the other side?
        - Tower of Hanoi
            * Move all discs from left peg to right one.
            * Only one disc moved at a time.
            * Disc can be place either on empty peg or on top of a larger disc
        - Forest Burners & Forst lovers
- Recognizing the **Isomorphic**
    * **Isomorphic** Problems: Same *formal structure* but different in *context*
    * Reed (1987) found that participants have diffuculuty recognizing that a pst problem's solution will help them to solve the current problem
        - Diffuculty recognizing crucial **commonalities**
            * **Analogous** Aspects
        - **Surface features** of the problem can distract from noticing underlying similarities
    * Current research: What factors help us transfer solutions to new isomorphic problems?
        - **Generalizability**
- **Ill-Structured Problems**
    * Examples
        - A women who lived in a small town married 20 differnt men in that same town. All of them are still living and she was never divorced any of them. Yet she broke no laws. How could she do this?
        - You have loose black and brown socks in a drawer, mixed in a ration of five black socks for every brown one. How many socks do you have to tak eout of that drawer to be assured of having a pair of the same color?
    * **Insight**: The apparent sudden solution to a problem some time after the problem has been presented
        - Requires **restructuring** of the **represnation** of the problem
        - Seeing it in a new way
- **Five Insight Theories**
    * **Gestalt View**:
        - Insight requires percieving the problem as a whole, not just in parts
        - Possible Mechanisms
            * Extended, unconsious leap in thught
            * Greatly accelereated mental processing
            * Short-circuting of normal reasoning process
        - Wertheimer (1945):
            * "Productive Thinking": Going beyond previously learned associations
                - vs. reproductive thinking based on existing, known associations
                - Sudden rearrangment of elemnts creates "insight"
        - Kohler (1927)
            * Non-human primate (chimp) model of insight
            * After lots of jumping, "Sultan" suddenly stacked boxes to get bananna
            * Insight as special process differing from normal, linear thought
        - Limitations
            * No convincing evidence of these underlying mechanisms
            * No operational definitoin of just what insight is
    * **The Nothing-Special View**
        - (Langley et al, 1987; Wisberg, 1986)
        - Insight is just an extension of ordinary perciving, recognizing learning, and conceiing.
            * Gestalists failed to prove it because "insight" doesn't exist as a unique problem-solving process
            * So-called "insight" probloems are sometime ssolved without mental restructing of the porblem
    * **The Neo-Gestaltist View** (Metcalfe, 1986)
        - Insightful problem solving is distinguished from non-insightful problem solving in two ways
            * When given "routine" problems: problem solvers show remarkable **acuracy** in their ability to *predict their own success* in solving a problem
            * When given "insight" problems: problem solvers show **poor ability** to **preidct their own success** prior to trying to solve the problems.
        - **Metcalfe & Weibe** (1987)
            * Particpants given either **insight** problems or **routine** problems
                - **Insight**: Prisoner attempting escape from a tower. Found his cell a rope which was half long enough to permit him to reach the ground safely. He divided the rope in half and tied two parts together and escaped. How could this be?
                - **Routine**: Algebra (3x^2 + 2x = 10)(3x) = ?, Tower of Hanoi, etc...
            * At 15 sec intervals, asked how close ("warm vs. cold") they fell they are solving it.
            * Results:
                - For **insight** problems: spike in warmth rating
                - For **routine** problems: A gradual "getting warmer"
    * **The Three-Process View**
        - (David & Sternberg, 1984)
        - **Selective-Encoding Insights**
            * Sorting relavant from irrelevanbt info to represnt in memory
            * Ex. Deciding what crucial points to note from lecture
        -  **Selective-Comparison Insights**
            * Novel perceptions of how **new & old info relate**
            * Ex. Learning new cognitive psych terms based on words you already know
        - **Selective-Combination Insights**
            * Combine **selectivly encoded and compared** info in a **novel way**
            * Ex. Writing a term paper by synthesizing key notes from articles 
    * **Insight Experience View**
        - (Schooler, Ohlsson, Brooks)
        - Proposes diffent mental systems used for insight
            * **Logical, transformation** problems use **verbal** system
            * **Insight prblems require **non-verbal** system
        - Schooler et all. (1993) stiudy:
            * Participants solved a series of insight and logic problems.
            * Experimental group: required to verbalize stragtgies aloud as they tried to slve the problem
            * Control group: did not solve problem aloud
        - **Solving insight problems (but not logic problems) was decreased when particpants wer eforced to use their vocal system**
- **More Insight** Research
    * "Insight" versus the "Insight Experience"
        - Routine problems may demand putting info togehter in novel ways (insight) but....
        - May happen gradually, without the "a-ha" sensation of sudden mental restructuring (insight experience)
    * Brain activity studies (fMRI)
        - Right hippocampus is active during problem solving
        - Spike in temporal lobe just before insight
    * **Sleep** may aid insight
    * Insights may be brilliant or dead **wrong**...
- **Obstacles** to Problem Solving
    * **Mental Set**
        - **Seeing a problem in a particular way** instead of other plausible ways due to **entrenchment** or **fixation**
        - May cause you to adopt an ineffective strategy and prevent problem solving
        - May make assumptions without realizing it
        - May find it hard  to approach the problem in a new way
    * **Functional Fixedness**
        - Inability to assing new function and roles to elemnts of a problem
        - Diffucluty using old tools in new ways
        - Examples:
            * Two string problem
            * Dunker's candle porblem
                - You have: a candle, box of thumb tacks, book of matches.
                - Attach the candle to wall so it doesn't drip onto table below
            * Reshape coat hanger to get into car
            * Sprining door lock with a credit card
            * Using dime as a screwdriver
    * **Stereotypes** 
        - Belief that members ofsocial group unifomly have certain characteristics
        - Targets can suffer (e.g. as scapegoats for social maltreatment)
        - Users also suffer (imparied problem solving)
        - Such overgeneraliziation often develops by age six
            * Gender, racial, ethnic, religious, regional
- **Transfer**
    * Any carryover of knowledge or skills from one problem situation to another
    * **Negative Transfer**
        - Solving prior problem makes it more diffucult to solve later problem
    * **Positive Transfer**
        - Solving earlier problems helps to solve later problem
    * May require *recognition* of *analogies* between problems
    * **Convergence Pattern**: comparison based on partial similarity of the congintive process and linguistic expression of transferring info or meaning from the source (analogue) to target
        - Heart *is like* a pump
    * **BLANK Transfer**: Glick & Holyoak (1980)
        - Give participants one problem to read with a solution
            * "Military problem" (aka "generall/fortress")
        - Give same particpants a second problem which can be solved using a similar solution
            * "Radiation Problem"
        - Vary the instructions: hint at the analogy or no hint
        - 3 Groups of Particpants
            * Control Group: only got Radiaqtion problm
            * Analogy group: got Genral/Fortress problem & solution first, then radiation problem
            * Analogy + Hing group: got General/Fortress problem and told its solution would help in solving the radiation problem 
        - People can use **analogies**, but only if they **recognize** them
            * Often don't recognize analogies without hints:
            * explicit (instructed)
            * implicit (e.g. similar domain/context)
    * Factors Affecting **Positive Transfer** (use of analogy)
        - **Similarity** between problem and analogy
            * Similar domain or context, similar surface features
        - **Number of examples** exposed to:
            * When Military story was just one of three other heard before Radiation problem, only 20% correct.
        - Whether **BLANK*** for similar problem is **activated**
            * if problems seperated by delays or in differnt context almost nobody reocgnizs or uses the anlogy
- **Incubation**
    * **Put** away from a problem provides new insights or otherwise facilitates the problem solving process
    * Possible reasons/mechanisms:
        - Release from a problem solving set, or functional fixedness
        - Integration of recent with existing information
        - Retrieval of new information by changing context
        - Recovery from fatigue (working memory)
        - Changes in mental arousal state
- **Expertise**
    * Not a **general ability** to all all problems
        - Experts have extensive knowledge in a problem domain 
    * Expert knowledge is used to organize, represent, and interpret information
    * Affects ability to understand, reason, and solve problems
    * Chase & Simon (1973) & DeGroot (1965)
        - Participants: chess masters and beginning chess players
        - Studied a chess board that hda the pieces randomly display or a chess board with piece in the middle of a game
        - Beginners and experts had to recall as many pieces as they could
        - Results:
            * Master chess players (expers) and beginning players (novices) recalled a similar number of pieces from the radnom board
            * Master chess player rember signifigantly more chess pieces from the game board in progress than did the begining players
    * So... How do Experts differ from Novices
        - Better recall
        - Well organized knowledge in specific domain
        - Less time to set up problem
        - Select more appropriate strategies
        - Faster at solving problems
        - Are more adept
- Is it Innate talent or Acquired skill?
    * Clear that expertise requeies some skill
    * But some performance is only explainable by learned knowledge level alone
        - Genetic (innate) endowment, other enviromental factors
    * Why do anything intesnivly for 10 years?
        - Dedication is presumably crucial to sustain efforful, long-term practice
        - Where does such motivation/determination come from?   
            * Extrinsic, Instrinsic, Innate?
