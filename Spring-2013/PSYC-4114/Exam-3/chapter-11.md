- Animal Language Research
    * Simpler models of behavior than humans
    * Fewer ethical constraints
        - Thought sitll need ethics committee approval
    * Full time subjects
        - Ready avialable (new any "no shows')
        - Complete control of enviroment
    * Comparitive analysis
- "Washoe" the Chimp
    * PReivous attempts to teach cimpanzees verbal language failed
    * Gardner (1966) taught si8gn language to female chimp named "Washoe"
    * Critereon for realibity for each of Washoe's signs
    * Washoe was able to use word "more" appropriatly in differnt contexts
    * First words were "mor tickling"
    * Transfered sign dog to the sound of barking by an unseen dog
    * Acquired around 250 words in ASL
    * Washoe the speaking chimp died 11/07 at age 42.
    * Chomsky and Piker raised doubts
        - Language is unique to humans
        - Hmo sapients evolved neural device after evolutionary split from other primates
- Beyond Washoe
    * Bodamer, Fouts, Fouts, & Jensvold (1994)
        - Stuedied private signing by chimpanzees
        - Found private signing is robust
    * Garder & Garder (1989)
        - Washoe adopted an infant chimp named Loulis
        - No humans signed in front of infant chimp
        - Loulis still manged to learn over 50 signs from other chimpanzees
        - No active teaching, rather Loulis just learned
- Nim Chimpsky (Terrace)
    * Used reigious method to train Nim ASL, but..
    * Skeptical fo the reported success of the chimpanzees like Washoe
    * Compared their behavior to that of pigeons who are
    * Nim learned signs for many words: dirty, sleep, biute, and angry (up to 125 words), but...
    * Only prgamatic (to eachireve outcome); not expression of thughts, ideas
    * No greammar/syntax organization
        - Alternated sgining "Give Nim banana", "banana give nIm" "banana nim give"
    * Repition only. No creation of new phrases
    * His most used signes were drink, gum, banana, and more
    * are all chimps like pigeons when it comes to language, or was it just Nim?
    * Nuture effects? Lived first 10 months in a lab before increased human contact
    * Pygmy chimps show created combination of visual symbols of a leanred sign language and understand some spoken language
- Koko (Gorilla, Age 35)
    * Penny Patterson raising lowland gorilla since 1972
    * Taught Koko sign lanaguage
    * Has greater voculatry than Nim
    * Uses more words per utterence
    * Patterson & Liden (1981)
        - Koko uses structure, is creatuive, and spontnous in her lenavues
        - Understnad and uses humor
    * Koko now have vocab of over 1000 signs, and understands even more spoken english
- Animal vs. Human langauge
    * Human language facility far exceeds even our closest non-human relatives
        - Chimps: over 95% gentically identical to us
        - Chip "lagnuage" repetoire is small,er less ophisticated in structure, spotenousely acquired, generative
        - And, they still use flip phones
    * Chomsky suggest skepticism:
        - If animal had capaticy biologically advcantgeous as language nbut somehow hand' used it until now, it would be an evolutionarly miralce, like finding an island of humand who could be taugft to fly

Chapter 11 - Problem Solving
============================
- Problem Solving 
    * An effort to covercome obstacles obstructinvg the path to a solution (Reed, 200)
    * Initial State
        - Current situation
        - define the porblm
    * Goal State
        - Desierd Objective
    * Obstacles
        - Choices made about limitations
        - Strategy choices
        - Limited resources
- Problem Solving Cycle
    * Steps to know....
    * Idnetify Problem
    * Define Problem
    * Select Stragtegy
    * rganize Info
    * Allocate Resouces
    * Monitor Solving
    * Evalutate Success
- Problem Identification
    * IDrentify a situation as problematic
        - Recognizing that you have a problemt o solve
    * Sound odd, but often a diffucult step. May fail to recognize:
    * That we have a problem
        - Not always presented, must be discovered
        - I've developed a drinking problem
- Problem Deifinition and Represneation
    * Define the nature of th eproblem
        - Mental reprensation of: initual state, goal state, allowable operatores (move), constraints
    * Must accuratvly define a problem to solve it
    * Not always easy
        - Depends in part on one's knowledge
        - Pior knowledge can help or hinder
        - Requries determing what information is relevant vs. irrelevant
- Strategy Formation
    * Select a strategry to solve the problem
    * Analysis
        - Brekaing into sub goals
        - Study for exam sub goals
            * Read textbook & class notes
- Stregry fomration
    * Divergent thinking
        - Generate multiple solutions to problem
        - Brainstorm all options
        - Will revisit when we discuss creativity
    * Convergent thinking
        - Narrow down to best answer
        - After allowing some divergent thinking
- Organization of Information
    * Organizinf info aids problem solving
    * Miht oranize visually using
        - Symbols
        - Matrixes
        - Diagrams
- Final Steps:
    * Resources Allocation
        - How much time, effort, $, should I put into this problem
    * Monitoring
        - Am I on track as I proceed to solve this problem?
- Types of Problems
    * Well structures problems
        - Have a clearn goal & path (formula) to the solution
            * Math problems, anagrams, most school tests (history, geography, etc.) often content-specific
        - E.g. find the area of a prallelogram
        - Cognitive Psychology "Move Problems"
            * Requires specific series of moves (tranformations) forom initual to goal (end) state
            * TOwer of Hanoi/London: move all discs to right in fewest number of moves
        - Error Types: inadvertent move backward, illegal moves, getting stuck (not sure what to do next, may have to move backward first)
    * Ill sturcutred problems
        - Problem space not well defined; no easy solution path to infer, may be more than one correct solution
            * Two strings problem (tie together 2 suspended strings - can't reach both)
            * How to find an apartment, house
            * What figts to buy, what to put on your iwsh list
            * Write a term paper, book
            * Who to sleect as friends, life partner
- Methods for Stydiyng Problem Solving
    * Error analysis or reaction time
        - Global measure of performance
    * Verbal protocols
        - Pariticpants speak their thoughts out loud while solving problems
        - Strategies beocme evidenect
- Newell and Simon (1972)
    * Problem Space
        - All possible actions (Strageies) that can be applied to a problem to geth to the solution
    * Consists of states and operators
        - States represnt the problem
            * Intial State - given information & prior knowledge
            * Goal State - desired outcome / solution
        - Operators transform 
    * Create da General Problem Solver (GPS)
        - Discussed further in Ch13 Artificial Intelligence
        - based on Verbal protocol
        - Repdocued on computer using a production rule system to create  a simlar represntation of th eproblem
            * Used a means-end analysis heuristic
- zStragies to Solve Problems
    * Algorithm
        - Systematic proceudre garunteed (if correctly specified ) to find a solution
        - Sequence of operations in a problem space
        - Repeated over and over until condition is satisfied
        - Words well on computers
            * Requires high processing speed
            * Compute nuemrous possible combinations
        - HUmans: limited processing speed, fewer operations at once (working memory)
    * Heuristic
        - Useful rule of thumb based one experience
        - "Mental shortcuts"
            * Infomration, intuitive, speculative stragies that sometimes work
        - Efficient: less burdern on our limited-capacity working memory
- Hueristics
    * Means-end Analysis
        - Compare your current state witht he goal and choose an action to ribg you closer to the goal - try to minimize the idstance )difference reduction)
        - Breka problem donw into smaller goals
        - May now rodk if correct subgoals cannot be identified
    * Working Forward
