    .title Factors Influencing the Acceptance of Generics 
    -# Introduction
    %p Generics are propositions in language which ascribe properties to kinds rather than to quantifiable instances (Khemlani, Leslie, and Glucksberg, 2011).  The generic proposition "swans lay eggs" is different from the quantifiable proposition "some swans lays eggs" in that the former case involves no <i>quantity</i> bound to "swans". What factors or conditions play into our accepting and regarding as "true" generics ascribing properties to kinds, free of quantification? The answer to this question is far from simple however the literature indicates several factors or conditions that may be considered in our acceptance or rejection of generics (Khemlani et al., 2011). If our acceptance of generics was purely rooted in a numerical or statistical model then considering only a small statistical portion of ticks carry Lyme disease what would make us accept the generic "ticks carry Lyme disease" (Khemlani et al., 2011)?  Generics such as "ticks carry Lyme disease" may be viewed as having a "striking" or dangerous factor that makes the generic acceptable regardless of statistical prevalence (Cimpian, Brandone, and Gelman, 2010). While cognitive biases (such as striking instances) may play a role in our acceptance of generics; statistical prevalence still must hold some weight in our acceptance or rejection of any given generic (Cimpian et al., 2010). In this paper I will examine the factors which influence the acceptance of generics.
    %p I will integrate between three core articles surrounding the literature on the factors influencing the acceptance of generics. A first article by Chambers, Graham, and Turner (2008) entertains quantified evidence as a factor for the acceptance of generics by examining the cognitive development of preschoolers.  Another article by Cimpian et al. (2010) extends the quantified evidence notion to statistical prevalence shifting the focus for acceptance of generics from purely counting instances of kinds to comparing between instances of kinds.  A third article by Khemlani et al. (2011) explores several additional factors influencing generics acceptance suggesting that factors considered in influencing generics acceptance need be extended beyond a purely numerical or statistical model.

    %h2 I. Quantified Evidence
    %p The number of instances exhibiting a property expressed by a generic may be an essential factor influencing a generic's acceptance and use. If one white swan passes by, do we have evidence to accept that "swans are white"? How about if two, three, or a hundred swans pass by? 
    %p Chambers et al. (2008) explored the possibility that <i>quantified evidence</i> is a relevant condition for the acceptance of generics by examining preschoolers' willingness to extend a generic to new category members.  Chambers et al. presented preschoolers with a group of similar clay figures of varying quantities and then told the preschoolers a generic ascribing a descriptor (e.g., shy, gentle, mean) applied to the group. Subsequently, the preschoolers were asked to judge if a new clay figure, of similar appearance to the original group, should be described in line with the generic (Chambers et al., 2008). For example, the experimenter would first label the group of clay figures and then provide a generic: "These are pagons. Pagons are friendly." (Chambers et al., 2008). Then a new member was introduced and the child was prompted: "Is this pagon friendly?" (Chambers et al., 2008). The quantity of the number of clay figures in the original group varied from trial to trial in order to understand the role of quantity in regards to generic acceptance (Chambers et al., 2008). In the weak evidence condition, the children were presented with 2 clay figures of similar appearance in the group; while in the strong evidence condition, children were presented with 5 clay figures of similar appearance in the group (Chambers et al., 2008). Additionally, in order to confirm that the children could discern between non-generic and generic statements, the phrasing of the questions presented to children varied testing generic (e.g., "pagons are friendly") and non-generic (e.g., "these pagons are friendly") forms (Chambers et al., 2008).
    %p It was found that while sample size did modulate children's willingness to attribute the generic property to new members, the effect was not significant (Chambers et al., 2008). Differing the number of members in a category from 2 to 5 had no statistically significant effect on subsequent tendency to place new members into a given category (Chambers et al., 2008). Chambers et al. (2008) did find however that varying wording from generic to the non-generic form did have a significant effect on the new member's attribution. It was found that children were much more likely to attribute new clay figures to the category when the category was presented as a generic (73.6%) rather than as a non-generic (42.0%) (Chambers et al., 2008). The results of this study suggest that quantified evidence, at least in isolation, is not a sufficient factor contributing to the acceptance and use of generics. However, the results of this study prompt us to question what factors might have played into generic forms more readily facilitating classification by children over non-generic forms.

    %h2 II. Statistical Prevalence
    %p Although Chambers et al. (2008) demonstrated that quantified evidence alone has little prospect as a factor influencing the acceptance of generics, there still remains an alternative related factor which may influence generics acceptance: statistical prevalence.  If there were ten boys in a room and eight of the ten boys had short hair it would seem reasonable of us to entertain the generic "boys have short hair". Dismissing quantified evidence and turning to statistical prevalence, the focus shifts from purely counting instances of kinds, to comparing between instances of kinds.
    
    %p Unlike Chambers et al. (2008) which hoped to show that quantity has an effect on generics acceptance, Cimpian et al. (2010) aimed to directly correlate statistical prevalence (in percentage) with generics' acceptance. As such, in each trial participants were asked to link a provided generic to an <i>implied</i> percentage they believed the generic applied to the kind <i>or</i> to determine given a percentage of a population if a generic was true (Cimpian et al., 2010). It was found that the average statistical prevalence for a generic to be accepted as true was 69.1% of the kind exhibiting the property (Cimpian et al., 2010).  These results demonstrate clearly that statistical prevalence plays a significant role in the acceptance of generics. However, these results conflict with Chambers et al. (2008) results suggesting that altering a quantity of members of category has no significant effect on generics acceptance. This discordance can be explained by taking note that the methodology between the two studies was significantly different. In Chambers et al. (2008) preschoolers were asked to assign a new instance to a kind as described by a generic; while in Cimpian et al. (2010), participants were simply asked whether a certain generic could be ascribed given a percentage of the kind exhibiting a given property. In terms of factors influencing the <i>acceptance</i> of a generic, Cimpian et al. (2010) provides us with strong evidence that statistical prevalence plays a role into the acceptance of a generic.
  
    %p One additional interesting finding from Cimpian et al. (2010) was that: using the same set of generics, accepted generics were viewed as being indicative of 95.8% of the population on average.  This leads us to question why generics, once accepted, are almost universally held true of all instances of the generic? It took only 69.1% of the population exhibiting the property for a generic to be viewed as "true"; however, the same generics once accepted were viewed as being indicative of 95.8% of the kind (Cimpian et al., 2010). This statistical paradoxical asymmetry of generics acceptance and implied prevalence suggests that there are likely other additional conditions governing the acceptance of generics (Cimpian et al., 2010).


    %h2 III. Characteristic and Striking Properties
    %p A hypothesis by Leslie et al. (2008), the <i>generics hypothesis</i>, proposes that several factors account for our acceptance of generics (cited in Khemlani et al., 2011). Two factors of significant importance highlighted are: characteristic properties and striking properties (Khemlani et al., 2011).  A characteristic property is a property of a kind so distinct and characteristic of the kind that causes a generic to be accepted readily in spite of opposing statistical prevalence (e.g., "ducks lay eggs") (Khemlani et al., 2011). A striking property is a dangerous property need only be held by a few members in a kind to be accepted in spite of statistical prevalence (e.g., "ticks carry Lyme disease") (Khemlani et al., 2011).
    
    %p Khemlani et al. (2011) confirmed that characteristic and striking properties have an influence on the acceptance of generics in a study in which participants were asked to rate their confidence of inferences derived from generics. Participants were firstly presented with a category membership (e.g., "Fido is a dog") and then with a predicate based on a generic from the category (e.g., "Fido has a tail") and asked to rate how confident they were that the predicate was correct (+3) or incorrect (-3) (Khemlani et al., 2011). Unlike Cimpian et al. (2010) and Chambers et al. (2008), the actual generics were intentionally never presented to the participants. Khemlani et al. (2011) not explicitly presenting the generic is a strong experimental design decision and it could be contended to greatly increase the study's internal validity.  Khemlani et al. (2011) found that generics exhibiting characteristic properties held a mean confidence rating of +2.15, while generics exhibiting striking properties held a mean confidence rating of +0.7. These results give some explanation and further the results of Cimpian et al. (2010) in suggesting that statistical prevalence alone cannot explain generics acceptance.

    %p Additionally, Cimpian et al. (2010) provided evidence that characteristic and striking properties have influence on the acceptance of generics. Participants were more likely to deem true generics involving characteristic and striking properties (e.g., Mosquitoes carry the West Nile virus) than plain generics (e.g., Lorches have purple feathers) (Cimpian et al., 2010). Cimpian et al. (2010) posits that factors influencing a generic being accepted act <i>independently</i>. In other words, Cimpian et al. (2010) proposes that rather than one "factor" directly impacting the acceptance of a generic, certain attributes and cognitive dispositions may apply to all feed into the acceptance of a generic. As such, prevalence, characteristic, and striking properties may all play a role in the acceptance of any given generic.

    %h2 VI. Conclusion
    %p There are many potential factors which could influence our acceptance and employment of generics. Several of these potential factors were analyzed above and one very relevant analysis that emerges is that there is not <i>one</i> factor in particular in any given situation that could be said to be responsible for the acceptance of a generic. A generics acceptance is contextual and may be influenced by cognitive biases. Combinations of many factors may play into the acceptance or rejection of a generic.
