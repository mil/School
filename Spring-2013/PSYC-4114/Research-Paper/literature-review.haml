    .title Conditions for the Acceptance of Generics and Generics Implications
    -# Introduction
    %p Generic statments (or *generics*), in language, are held assumptions about members of a kind which provide humans with quantification-independent set-theoretic basis for inferential reasoning.  Generics (e.g "Dogs have four legs") provide us with grounding for reasoning about essential properties of kinds. Generics help us to highlight which qualities or properties of specific instances of kinds extend to the kinds as wholes. Understanding how properties extend to kinds is an essential part of inferential and deductive reasoning and in accordance may be acquired in several manners. The simplest cognition helping us to understand the relation of properties to kinds is that of direct observation. (Hollander et al., 484) Imagine that a child who has never seen a cat before sees three brown and white striped cats walk by. Does the child now have the evidence to say that all cats have brown and white stripes? Or perhaps merely that all cats are striped? The point at which we make such inferences to accept the generic form is a critical question, however, also there is the question of how these generics are viewed and our expectations surrounding them in regards to other's knowledge. Does the lack of quantiifcation in a generic lead us to hold certain assumuption about the generic in contrast with quantified statements? This paper reviews three representiative studies to both: 1) critique the cognitive conditions under which properties of kinds are taken to be represntative of the kinds and 2) the implications of accepting generics on subsequent dispoitions and inferential reasoning.
    %p In this paper, I will integrate between three core articles and number of supplementary material surrounding generics in regards to these two . The first article by Cimpian et al. explores the nature of how children come to expect generics to be widely shared knowledge in comparison to quantified assertions. The second article by Khemlani et al. examines the conditions and elasticity under which generics are accepted positing that statistical quantification prevelence model cannot soley account for how humans infer and deem properties to kinds. The third article suggests reasoning behind why generics are accepted independnet of what was found in Khemlani et al. positing that generics are a default interpretation of members of kinds for children in comphrending the set-theoritic and semantic nature of our potentially quantificational language.

    %h2 Conditions for Accepting Generics
    %p The base rate or prevelence hypothesis is the prima facie most pragmatic hyopthesis for trying to understanding the conditions under which we accept generics. The prevelence hypothesis suggests that we cognitivly compute the correct statistics about the prevelence of properties relation to kinds in forming the abstract quantification-free generics. As such if there were ten boys in a room and eight of the ten boys had short hair it seems reasonable of us to infer that "the boys have short hair" is true. This instance of an <i>exestinially quantified</i> statement refers to concrete members of kinds in the real world. Dropping "the" from "the boys have short hair" leaves us with the generic "boys have short hair". Accepting "boys have short hair" would seem acceptable in this hypothetical scenario and this is the grounding for the explanatory power of the prevelence hyopthesis in understanding generics. 
    %p However, where the prevelence hypothesis comes up short is in explaning generics often accepted in discordance with the actual statistical prevelence. For example, Brandone et al. found that "ticks carry Lyme disesase" is a generic that is readily accepted although only an incredibly small proporion (much under half) of tick do in fact carry Lyme's disesase. Also, another statement readily accepted is the generic "ducks lay eggs". While the majoiry of ducks do not lay eggs (i.e ducklings, males, infertile females), the generic is readily accepted.
    %p To explain these discordances which the prevelence hypothesis fails to account for, Leslie (2007) hypothesized that generics are sensitive to four factors. The first factor under which a generic is accepted, in spite of statical prevelence, is that of a <i>distinct</i> and characteristic property of a kind. For example, the generic "chairs have four legs" would be readily accepted because having four legs is quintessential to the function of what we think of as a chair. The second factor under which a generic is accepted is if just some members of the kind have a property but it is a <i>striking</i> or dangerous property. "Ticks carry Lyme disease" is an example of a striking generic. The third factor under which generics are sensitive is prevelence as previously discussed. However, Leslie notes that prevelence may be accepted if the property is neither dangerous nor characteristic. One example of the prevelence hyopthesis is "cars have radios". The final factor to which generics are sensitive is equally salient alternative properties. If a generic has an equally salient alternative propery it is rejected. For example, the generics "books are paperbacks" and "ducks are female" will be readily rejected because "books are hardcover" and "ducks are male" are equally salient alternatives to the generics.


    %p Generics form much of our basic beliefs and dispositions that guide our reasoning () in everyday life. Generics serve as a fundamental as it will be seen cannot be explained strictly through a statical model. 

    %p One theoretical model for explaining the acceptance of generics is the prevelence hypothesis which states: generics are held true in virtue of statical prevelence of members of a kind.  As such, under the prevelence hypothesis, the generic "dogs have four legs" is accepted beacuse this is true for the majority of dogs. However, the prevelence model fails at addressing generics accepted but incoinsistent with a statics. For exmaple, the generic that "Mosquitos carry West Nile virus" is often accepted and deemed true but is wholly inaccurate as not <i>all</i> mosquitoes carry the West Nile Virus. Another example generic which the prevelence hypothesis faiuls to explain is: "Swans lay eggs". This paper reviews the existing literature exploring both the suspectibly and reasoning involved in humans to accept generics as true and also the wide implications of generics in h

    %p Addressing generics in language causes us to wonder what are the factors that make us more readily accept generics in spite of only a small portion of the kind exhibiting a certain facotr. What attributes makes one more readily accept a generic and universal? 

    %p Without scope, generics tend to be sensitive to four factors: Firstly, if a generic is indicative of a characteristic property of a kind, it is accepted regardless of prevalence. Secondly, if a generic is indicitive of striking of dangerous properties of a kind, the generic is accepted more readily even in instances of low prevelence of the kind. Thirdly, generics tend to be more readily accepted if the property is exhibited in the majority of the kind. Finally, generics are rejected if they have a property for which an opposite generic may be drawn.


    %h2 Factors Influencing Accepting Generics

    %p Previously it was commonly thought that characteristic prevelence dictated the acceptance of a general statement. The generics 

    %p This study suggest that the acqusition of generics (about kinds) is sensitive to specific biases rather than being grounded in simple statistical prevelence alone. In this study, in each trial, subjects were given a category membership assertion (e.g "Snoozy is a cat") and asked to rate their agreement with a conclusion based on the generic (e.g "Snoozy is an animal"). Subjects used a 7 point Likert scale to rate their aggreement where +3 meant "I'm confident it's true" and -3 meant "I'm confident it's false". Subjects were given 90 items total incorporating several different generics types. If reasoning about arbitrary members of kinds was governed by statical prevelance then the reason why one might infer a dog named Pup has four legs would be because *most* dogs have four legs. The results of the study demonstrated that prevelance played a role in inference such that there was a strong relationship  between mean confidence ratings and estimated prevalence. However, in numerous items estimated prevelence and agreement to the generic differed strongly. One item included in the set of which this estimate relevelence and agreement to the generic diverged was: "ticks carry Lyme disease". This is an example of a striking generic in which this study showed the confidence rating to be 0.70 which is strange as majority FG items confidence rating was close at 0.70.

    %p The previlence estimates drastically different (24% vs. 60%).  This discordance was found in the generic types of: striking items (e.g "ticks carry Lyme disease"), majory false generalization items (e.g "books are paperbacks"), and majority statistical items (e.g "cars have radios").

    %p This study positivly supports my research question by showing that the prevelence hypothesis alone cannot account for interferial reasoning about members of kinds. 

    %p This study suggests that generics are more expected to be widely shared than quantified assertions in children 4- to 7-years old. Children in each trial of the experiment were presented with a picture and the picture was labeled (e.g "This is a hedgehog"). Then, a novel fact was presented to the child in either generic ("e.g "Hedgehogs eat hexapods") or quantified form (e.g "This hedgehog eats hexapods"). Subsequently,  the child was asked wether other people knew these facts (specifically whether their moms knew). An RM-OLR was used for data analysis due to many children tending to be consistent in their answers across trials (data points clustered around 0% and 100%). Cohen's d was used as a measure of effect size. Signifigant results indicate that children did infact assume the generics to be known (M = 50.5%) over the quantified from being known (M = 28.1%).
    %p It was found that children were indeed more likley to assume that other people knew generics more than quantified assertions. 

    %p 
      In addition this study added support supporting the 'threat' generic factor.----

      Children participants were given a picture of an animal drawing and said 'This is a kevta' and then told 'Let me tell you something about kevtas. Kevtaas have two humps'. The child was shown two more pictures of animal drawings and asked to pick out the other kevta.

      A 2x2x2 ANOVA was used to analyze the reuslts.
