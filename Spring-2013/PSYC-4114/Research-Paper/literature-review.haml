    .title Conditions for the Acceptance of Generics and Generics Implications
    -# Introduction
    %p Generic statments (or *generics*), in language, are held true assumptions about members of a kind which provide humans with quantification-independent set-theoretic basis for inferential reasoning.  Generics (e.g., "Dogs have four legs") provide us with grounding for reasoning about essential properties of kinds. Generics help us to highlight which qualities or properties of specific instances of kinds extend to the kinds as wholes. Understanding how properties extend to kinds is an essential part of inferential and deductive reasoning and in accordance may be acquired in several manners. The simplest cognition helping us to understand the relation of properties to kinds is that of direct observation. (Hollander et al., 484) Imagine that a child who has never seen a cat before sees three brown and white striped cats walk by. Does the child now have the evidence to say that all cats have brown and white stripes? Or perhaps merely that all cats are striped? The point at which we make such inferences to accept the generic form is a critical question, however, also there is the question of how these generics are viewed and our expectations surrounding them in regards to other's knowledge. Does the lack of quantiifcation in a generic lead us to hold certain assumuption about the generic in contrast with quantified statements? This paper reviews three representiative studies to both: 1) critique the cognitive conditions under which properties of kinds are taken to be represntative of the kinds and 2) the implications of accepting generics on subsequent dispoitions and inferential reasoning.
    %p In this paper, I will integrate between three core articles and number of supplementary material surrounding generics in regards to these two . The first article by Cimpian et al. explores the nature of how children come to expect generics to be widely shared knowledge in comparison to quantified assertions. The second article by Khemlani et al. examines the conditions and elasticity under which generics are accepted positing that statistical quantification prevelence model cannot soley account for how humans infer and deem properties to kinds. The third article suggests reasoning behind why generics are accepted independnet of what was found in Khemlani et al. positing that generics are a default interpretation of members of kinds for children in comphrending the set-theoritic and semantic nature of our potentially quantificational language.

    -# Conditions under which generics are accepted
    %h2 Conditions for Accepting Generics
    %p The base rate or prevelence hypothesis is the prima facie most pragmatic hyopthesis for trying to understanding the conditions under which we accept generics. The prevelence hypothesis suggests that we cognitivly compute the correct statistics about the prevelence of properties relation to kinds in forming the abstract quantification-free generics. As such if there were ten boys in a room and eight of the ten boys had short hair it seems reasonable of us to infer that "the boys have short hair" is true. This instance of an <i>exestinially quantified</i> statement refers to concrete members of kinds in the real world. Dropping "the" from "the boys have short hair" leaves us with the generic "boys have short hair". Accepting "boys have short hair" would seem acceptable in this hypothetical scenario and this is the grounding for the explanatory power of the prevelence hyopthesis in understanding generics. 
    %p However, where the prevelence hypothesis comes up short is in explaning generics often accepted in discordance with the actual statistical prevelence. For example, Brandone et al. found that "ticks carry Lyme disesase" is a generic that is readily accepted although only an incredibly small proporion (much under half) of tick do in fact carry Lyme's disesase. Also, another statement readily accepted is the generic "ducks lay eggs". While the majoiry of ducks do not lay eggs (i.e ducklings, males, infertile females), the generic is readily accepted.
    %p To explain the prevelence hypotheses shortcomings, Leslie (2007) posited the generics hypothesis suggesting that generics are sensitive to four factors. Firstly, a generic may be accepted in spite of statical prevelence, if the property of the generic is <i>distinct</i> and characteristic to the kind. For example, the generic "chairs have four legs" would be readily accepted because having four legs is quintessential to the function of what we think of as a chair is. Secondly, a generic may be accepted if just some instances of the kind have the property but the property is <i>striking</i> or dangerous. "Ticks carry Lyme disease" is attributes a striking and dangerous characteristic to ticks and thus the generic is accepted. Thirdly, a generic may be accepted in light of prevelence if the property is neither dangerous nor characteristic. The generic "Cars have radios" is accepted because it neither presents as distinct nor striking but merely a prevelent characteristic of cards. Fourth and finally, a generic may be rejected if an equally salient alternative property is cognitivly aviable. The generics "books are paperbacks" and "ducks are female" will be readily rejected because "books are hardcover" and "ducks are male" are equally salient cognitivly avialble alternatives to the generics in question.

      Khemlani et al. added supporting evidence to the explanatory power of Leslie's generics hypothesis for the acceptance of generics. Subjects were presented with pairs of statements consisting of: a premise illustrating an instance of a kind (e.g., "Jeff is a car") and a conclusion that would likely be held if the generic associated with the premise was held (e.g, "Jeff has a radio"). The actual generic was not used in the design. Names of instances were chosen to be gender-neutral asnot to not potentially affect results. Subjects for each pair were report their confidence ("I'm confident it's true" or "I'm confident it's false") on a 7-point Likert scale. 
    %p
      In line with the prevalence hypothesis, Khemlani et al. found that mean confidence ratings for minority characteristic (e.g., "ducks lay eggs") and majority characteristic (e.g., "cars have radios") did not differ signifigantly. However, signifigant discordance of confidence ratings and estimated prevelance was found when constrasting striking(e.g., "Ticks have Lyme disease") and majority false generalizations(e.g., "books are paperbacks"). First consider that striking items had a prevelence estimate of 24% and a confidence rating was 0.7. Now what is tellings it that majority false generalizations prevelence estimate was much higher at 60%, however they only had a confidence rating of 0.6. If a statistical model could account for the acceptance of generics, such as the prevelence hypothesis asserts, it would be expected that confidence for striking items would be much lower than majority false generalizations in line with the prevelenece of each. However, the confidence difference for such a dramatic difference in expected prevelence being only 0.1 adds strong supporting evidence that striking items are a component of the generics hypothesis that the prevelence hypothesis cannot alone account for.

      The next part of the generics puzzle is understanding our employment of generics in inferential reasoning. Cimpian &amp; Scott explored this question by contrasting generics and non-generics place in children's cognition in reference to knowledge of others.
