    .title Factors Influencing the Acceptance of Generics 
    -# Introduction
    %p The wording of a phrase in language has a great impact on how it is interpreted in reference to assigning any particular property to its kind. The phrase "swans lay eggs" is different "some swans lays eggs" which is also quite different from "most swans lay eggs". In the case of the latter two phrases, the subject, swans, is exesntially quantified. This means the claim asserts that there exists <i>at least one</i> swan that lays eggs. As such, the latter two phrases are similar in that they specify quantity. However how is the former case, "swans lay eggs", to be interpreted and what are the conditions under which such assertions (known as generics) are to be accepted.  Claiming that "swans are male" seems less likely to be accepted than "swans lay eggs", however why is this the case? Do we compute a staticial correct models for each generic to guide our inferences? Or, are we bound but certain cognitive biases in our acceptance of generics?  Several theoretical perspectives exist in the literature surrounding this puzzle.  In this paper I will examine the cognitive conditions influencing for the acceptance of generics such as "swans lay eggs" and further explore the implications of generics acceptance on these conditions.
    %p In this paper, I will integrate between three core articles surrounding the rich literature on the conditions under which generics are accepted. The first article by Chambers et al. explores the conditions for the acceptance of generics in the cognitive development of preschoolers. Through the second article by Khemlani et al., we will explores several factors influencing the acceptance of generics including: statistical prevelence, characteristics proprties, striking properties, and salient alternative properties. The third article by Cimpian et al will build upon the grounding established in Khemlani et al. and Chambers et al. to provide integrative evidence for conditions layed out for accepting in Khemalini et al. and then explores the wide implications accepting generics have on our cognition. 

    %h2 I. Quantificational Evidence
    %p The number of instances exhibiting a property expressed by a generic may be an essential factor influencing a generic's acceptance and use. If one white swan passes by, do we have evidence to accept that "swans are white"? How about if two, three, or a hundred swans pass by? 
    %p Chambers et al. explored the possibility that <i>quantificational evidence</i> is a relevant condition in the acceptance of generics by examining preschoolers' willingness extend a generic to new category members.  Preschoolers were presented with a group of similar clay figures of varying quantities and presented with a generic ascribing a descriptor (e.g., shy, gentle, mean) to the group. Subsequently, the preschoolers were asked to judge if a new clay figure, of similar appearance to the original group, should be described in line with the generic. For example, the experiment would first label the group of clay figures and then provide a generic: "These are pagons. Pagons are friendly". Then a new member was introduced and the child was prompted: "Is this pagon friendly?" The quantity of the number of clay figures in the original group varied from trial to trial in order to understand the role of quantity in regards to generic acceptance. In the weak evidence condition the children were presented with 2 clay figures of similar appear in the group; while in the strong evidence condition children were presented with 5 clay figures in the group. Additionally, in order to confirm that children could discern between non-generic and generic instances, the phrasing of the questions presented to children varied testing generic (e.g., "pagons are friendly") and the non-generic (e.g., "these pagons are friendly") forms.
    %p It was found that while sample size did modulate children's willingness to attriute the generic property to new members the effect was not signifigant. Differing the number of memebers in a category from 2 to 5 had no statistically siginifigant effect on subsequent tendency to place new members into a given category. Chambers et al.'s did find however that varying wording from generic to the non-generic form did have an affect on the new member's attribution. It was found that children were much more likely to attribute new clay figures to the category when the category was presented as a generic (73.6%) rather than as a non-generic (42.0%). Non-generic refers to a quantified phrase rather than an abstract phrase (e.g., "these pagons are friendly). The results of this study suggest that quantificational evidence, at least in isolation, is not a signfigant condition contributing to the acceptance and use of generics.

    %h2 II. Statical Prevelence
    %p Although Chamber et al. demonstrated that quantificational evidence alone has little prospect as a influecing the acceptance of generics, there still remains an alternative related factor which may influence generics acceptance: statistical prevelence.  If there were ten boys in a room and eight of the ten boys had short hair it would seem reasonable of us to entertain the generic "boys have short hair". Dismissing quantificational evidence and turning to statistical prevelence, the focus shifts from purely counting instances of kinds, to comparing between instances of kinds.
    %p Cimpian et al. investigated the notion of statistical prevlenece as a condition for accepting generics in a study in which participants were asked to correlate a generic with a percentage of the kind. In the study, participants were assigned to either a truth condition task or a implied prevelence task. In the implied prevelence task, participants were given a generic and then asked to judge what perecent of the population they believed exhibited the property expressed by the generic. Inversly, in the implied prevelence task, participants were given a statical prevelence relating to a generic (e.g., 30% of lorches have purple feathers) and then asked to decide (yes or no) if the generic was "true" of the whole kind. Analyzing the results of the implied prevelence task, it was found that the average statistical prevelence for a generic to be accepted was 69.1% of the kind exhibiting the property. However, using the same generics, it was found in the truth task that the generics once accepted were viewed as being indicitive of 95.8% of the population. As such, clearly staticial prevelence plays a signifigant role in the acceptance of generics, but why are generics once accepted almost universally held true of all instances of the generic? This statistical paradoxical asymetry of generics acceptance and implied prevelence suggests that there are likely other conditions governing the acceptance of generics. 

    %h2 III. Characteristic and Striking Properties
    %p A hypothesis by Leslie et al., the generics hypothesis, proposes that several factors play into the acceptance of generics (cited in Khemlani et al.) One factor of signifigant importance is: characteristic properties.  A characteristic property is a property of a kind so distinct and characteristic of the kind that causes a generic to be accepted in spite of prevelence. For example, the generic "ducks lay eggs" can easily be accepted because it seems that "laying eggs" is of characteristic nature of the "duck" kind. Additionally, striking properties are dangerous properties that need only a few members in a kind to be accepted in spite of statistical minority. An example of a generics accpeted in virtue of a striking property is "Ticks carry Lyme disease".
    
    %p Khemlani et al. confirmed that characteristic and striking properties have an influence on the acceptance of generics in a study in which participants were asked to rate their confidence of inferences derived from generics and generic agreements on a 7-point Likert scale. For confidence of infrences dervied from generics, participants were firstly presented with a category membership (e.g., Fido is a dog) and then with a predicate based on a generic from the cateogry (e.g., Fido has a tail) and asked to rate how confident they are that the predicate was correct (Likert +3) or incorrect (Likert -3). Unlike the Cimpian et al. and Chamber et al., in this study the generics was intentionally never presented to the participants. For generic agreement, participants were simply asked to rate their agreement with a generic (e.g., dogs have tails) on a 7 point Likert scale. This study found that characteristics properties did in fact hold signfigantly high generic agreement in contrast with generics based off of statistical prevelence. Additionally, adding more support that characteristic properties facotr into generic acceptance, "majority" (half of the mebers of the kind exhibit the property) and "minority" (under half of the members of the kind exhibit the property) yielded altering mean confidence ratings (2.6 for majority, 1.7 for minority). However, majority and minority characteristics yielded close generic agreement ratings (2.7 majority, 2.1 minority).
    %p 
      Cimpian et al. also provides converging evidence that characteristic and striking properties have influence on the acceptance of generics. Participants were more likely to interpret generics involving characteristic and striking as true, however it is noted that these effects should be viewed as indepent. In the study at hand, the main effect examined was statical prevelence 

    %h2 V. Equally Salient Alternatives

    %h2 VI. Conclusion
    %p There are many potentional conditions which could influence our acceptance and employment of generics. Viewing generics in a purely quantification or statistical model is naive. Likely, many factors influenced by our cognitive biases and dispotions influences our viewing generics as "true". Discerning between these conditions is an intruiging new outlet for future research in generics.
