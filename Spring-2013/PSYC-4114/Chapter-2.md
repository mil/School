Chapter 2 - Cognitive Neuroscience
==================================
- The _Scientific_ Study of Biological Substrates underlying Cognition
    * (neural basis of mental processes)
    * Possible levels of analysis:
        - Genes, bio/neuro, cognitive, behavior, enviroment
    * What is: _reductionism_ and why is it hazardous?
        - An attempt or tendency to explain a complex set of facts, entities, phenomena, or structures by another, simpler set.
        - Ignores **emergent properties**
            - Unique features that emerge when parts combine/interact.
            - Gestaltic: Whole is greater than the sum of its parts
- **The Nueron**
    * The Basic Unit of the Brain
        - The brain is complex cellular system of 
            * 10^11 nuerons
            * 10^14 synaptic connections
            * 10^12 = 1 Trillion, 10^15 = 1 Quadrillion
        -  Brain = ~100 Billion Nuerons
    * Parts of the Neuron
        - Soma
            * Cell body containing the nucleus
            * Integrates info from Dendrites
        - Dendrites
            * Branches that recieve information from other neurons (via Axons)
        - Axon
            * Information Transmitter
            * **Axon Terminal**:
                - Buttons at the ends of the axon
                -  Releases Neurotransmitters
            * **Synapse** (Synaptic Cleft)
                - Junctions between axons and dendrites
    * Action Potential
        - Brief change in voltage over surface.
        - Results in impulse transmission
- **Nuerotransmitters**
    * (Study the table 2.1 in the text)
    * Monoamines
        - _Synthesized by the nervous system_ through enyzmes on the amni acids in our diet
            * **Ach**: memory
            * **DA**: movement, attention, leanring
            * **Serotonin**: sleep/dream, mood
            * **Epinephrine**: alertness, F/F
    * Amino-Acid Neutotransmitters
        - Come from out diet _without_ further synthesis
            * GABA: leanring/memory
            * Glutamate: learning/memory
        - Nueromodulators
            * GABA inhibits presynaptic neurons
            * Glutamate excites presynaptic neurons
    * Neuropeptides
        - Peptide chains (two/more amnio acids)
            * Endorphins: pain relief
        - Produced b y pituitary gland & hypotalmus during
            * exercise, excitment, pain, spicy foods, love, orgasm
        - Resmeble optiates: produce analgesia & feeling o fwell-being
- **Postmortem** Studies
    * Identify disorder, and then examine _after death_
    * Famouse cases: 
        - Phineas gage (frontal lobe),
        - Tan (Broca's aphasic patient)
    * More Recent Example:
        - Young, Holcomb, Yazdani, Hicks & German (2004)
            * Found more nerve cells in the thalamus devoted to emtional regulation in dpressed people upon their death
- **Animal Studies** : In Vivo
    * Using **live** animals...
        - Single neuron monitorin
            * Implant microelectrode
            * Record electrical activity in response to stimulus
        - Tracing Studies

                - Absorbed by neurons
            * Trace anterograde (from soma/source to termination/synaptse) or retrograde (reverse)
            * To map neuronal connections & axon transport
        - Selective Lesioning
            * Cut neuronal connections
            * Observe deficits

            * A form of classical conditioning
            * UCS = puff of air
            * CS = tone
            * UR/CS = Blink
        - Hippocampus Pyramidal Neurons were monitored
        - Typically, older rabbits cannot lean the task
        - Tx Groups: Metrifonate, Galanthamine, or CI-1017:
            * Cholinestrase Inhibitors: Stop acetecholine breakdown

- Electroencephanlography
    * EEG: Recordings of broad electrical frequencies and instensities
        - Scalp voltage fluctuations from neuron ion currents
        - Delta, Theta, Alpha, Beta waves
    * Not well localized to specific cells
        - MRI & CT are more higher res (<1mm)
    * Good temporal (time scale) resolution)
- Event-Related Potentials
    * ERPs
        - Small change (<10 microvolts) in brain's electrical activity in response to a stimulus
            * E.g readinging a word, viewing a picture, hearing a sound)
        - Bckground noise removed, signal clarified (by avering EEG tracings over many stimulus presentations) to highlight signal
        - Poor Localization, but high temportal precision
            * Early latency (<100msec): sensing
            * Middle latency (100-250msec): thalmus & early cortical (perception)
            * Long latency (>250msec): higher-order processes
- EEG/ERP Research Examples
    * Dehaene-Lambertz, Pena, M., Christophe, & Landrieu(2004)
        - Examining speech processing in infants using EEG
            * Speech usually percieved by left hemisphere in adults
            * Case study: Baby girl with infarct in left lateral sulcus
            * Measured ERPs during speech perception tasks
            * Found right hemisphere also contributes to phoneme (language sounds) perception early in life
    * Martha Ann Bell's CAP Lab:
        - Examining working memory * emotional regulation across development -- here at VT
- **Brain Imaging Techniques**
    * Relatively non-invasive view of living brain
    * Two types: Structural and MRI
        - Structural: shows nueroanatomy, static picture
            * CAT (Computerized Axial Tmography)
               - Cat Scan = "X ray CT"
               - Focused X ray beams passed through at different angles
               - Different densitites deflect rays differently (bone, blood, brain, cebrospinal fluid)
               - Produces 9-12 image "slices" at different depths for 3-D image
               - Used in neuropsychological diagnosis
                    * Recent hemorrhage (blood) vs. older (cbs gluid); tumors
                - Quick but older technique, radiation exosure , fuzzier images than MRI
            * MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging)
                - Strong _magnetic field_ passed through the skull
                - Causes hydrogen (H) atoms in brain to align
                - Radio frequency signals alter the alignment
                    * Producing rotating magnetic field
                    * Which is detected by scanner - 3D image of structure
                        - E.g Violin players: larger area of R hemisphere (controls left hand)
                - Better contrast that CAT, no ionzing radiation
                - Magnets prclude metal in body (pacemakers)
                    * must lie still in small tunnel
                    * Expensive
        - **Functional**: show brain activity during a task
            * PET, fMRI
            * Functional - Metabolic Imaging: Positron Emission Tomography (PET)
                - Radioactive amterial (oxygen or glucose) is injected or inhaled
                - Blood flow or radioactive glucose consumtpion (metabolism) in brain measured
                    * More active regions consume more glucose (and oxygen)
                    * Subtraction method: activity during generalized task - during task of interest
                    * High IQ linked to less glucose use on cog. demanding tasks (efficeincy)
                    * Older (1970s), expensive, limited temporal resolution (1.5 minutes to an hour)
                    * SPEC (single-photon emission computed tomography) similar but cheaper than PET
                - Now one of most popular ways to study brain activation
                - Measures changes in _magnetic properties_ of blood as hemoglobin becomes deosygenated
                    * Like PET but no radioactive particles
                    * Magnet induces changes in osygen atoms
                    * Shows areas with less oxygen (i.e consumed)
                - Brain areas with more _blood flow_ have better visibility on MRI images
                    * Correlates with brain activation during a task
                - Less invasive & higher temporal resolution than PET
                - But more costly ($ and time)
