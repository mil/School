Chapter 2 - Cognitive Neuroscience
==================================
- **Basics** of **Cognitive Neuroscience**
    * The **Scientific** Study of **Biological Substrates** underlying Cognition
        * (Neural Basis of Mental Processes)
    * Possible **Levels of Analysis**:
        - Genes, Bio/Neuro, Cognitive, Behavior, Enviroment
    * What is: **Reductionism** and why is it hazardous?
        - **Reductionism**: Explaining complex set of facts, entities, phenomena, or structures by a simpler set.
        - Ignores **Emergent Properties**
            - _Unique features_ that _emerge_ when _parts combine_/interact.
            - **Gestaltic**: Whole is greater than the sum of its parts
    * **Nervous System**
        - Organized **network of cells** (nuerons)
        - Individual recieves info from enviroment
        - Nervous system process info and then interacts with the enviroment 
- **The Nueron**
    * The **Basic Unit** of the **Brain**
        - Nueron **transmits electrical signals** from one location to another in the nervous system
        - **Greatest concentration** of neurons in the **Neocortex**
        - The brain is complex **cellular system** of:
            * 10^11 nuerons
            * 10^14 synaptic connections
            * 10^12 = 1 Trillion, 10^15 = 1 Quadrillion
        -  Brain = ~100 Billion Nuerons
    * **Parts of** the **Neuron**
        - **Soma**
            * **Cell body** containing the **nucleus**
            * **Integrates** info **from Dendrites**
        - **Dendrites**
            * The Branches **extending from the Soma**
            * **Dendrites recieve** information from other neurons (via Axons)
        - **Axon**
            * **Long thin tube**, extends from soma which responds to info

            * **Two Kinds of Axons**
                - **Myelinated**: 
                    * Surrounded by the **myelin** (a white fatty substance) surrounding
                    * Has a mylin sheath: Insluates and protects longer axons from electrical interference
                        - Also speeds up conduction of information
                    * **Nodes of Ranvier**: Small gaps in myelin coating serving to increase conduction speed
                - **Un-Myelinated**: 
                    * Typically **shorter** and **smaller**

            * **Speech**: Impaired/abnormal
            * **Vision**: Restricted visual field
        - **Damage**:
            * Depends on severity, location, and speed of treatment
        - **Risk Factors**
            * _High_ **blood pressure** (biggest)
            * _High cholesterol, diabetes, smoking, alcohol use, drug use (esp. stimulants)_
            * Lack of physical activity
            * Obesity
    * **Brain Tumors** (AKA **Neoplasms**)
        - Can occur in **gray** or **white matter** of brain
            * **White is more common**
        - _Primary_ vs. _Secondary_:
            * **Primary**
                - **Starts in brain**
                - Childhood brain tumors (usually age 5+)
            * Secondary
                - **Starts elsewhere**
                - E.g. Lungs
        - _Benign vs. Malignant_ (Cancerous)
        - Detected by _CAT scans_ or _MRIs_
        - **Symptoms**:
            * _Headaches_, _Seizures_
            * Neurological Symptoms 
                - Memory, Concentratin, Personality, 
                - sleep, limbs, hearing, vision
                - speech
        - **Treatment**:
            * Surgery, Radiation, Chemotherapy
            * Also, anticonulsants, Physical/occupational therapty, counseloing
    * **Head Injury** (traumatic brain injury = **TBI**)
        - Closed-head vs. Open-head (skull penerated)
            * **Closed-Head**: 
                - Skull **remains in tact** but damage to the brain
                - Caused By: Mechanical force of a blow to the head
            * **Open-Head**
                - Skull **does not remain** in tact but is penetrated
                - Caused By: Ex. Bulletwound
        - **Loss of consciousness** is primary symptom
        - Common Frequency: 700K/year in North America
            * 70-90K pemanelty disabled
            * Speech, movement,
            * Cognitive Deficits: memory, attention, judgment, emotion regulation
- **Intelligence and Neuroscience**
    * _Intelligence and Brain Size_
        - Modest but signifigant relation
            * Only correlational data
                - Association doesn't tell us casual diretionality
        - **Females**: _Frontal lobe gray matter_ matters
        - **Males**: _Posterior gray matter_ matters more
    * **Intelligence and Neurons**
        - Conduction velocity may be + associated
    * **Intelligence and Brain Metabolism**
        - Efficiency: **smarter consume less glucose**?
            * _Controversial_: other studies show opposite (more glucose consumed)
    * **Biological Bases** of Intelligence Testing
        - IQ Tests: Over-focus on _crystallized_ (posterior) vs. _fluid_ intelligence
            * Goal setting, planning, reasoning, problem-solving (frontal, temporal lobes)
    * The **P-FIT Theory** of Intelligence
        - **Parieto-frontal integration** theory
        - Extrastriate cortex and fusionform gyrus
            * Recogniton, imagrery, and eleboration of visual input
    * (Executive Functions) : 
        - Only Working Memory, attentional control, Bx Inhibition, Planning, Monitoring
