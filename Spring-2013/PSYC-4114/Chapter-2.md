Chapter 2 - Cognitive Neuroscience
==================================
- **Basics** of **Cognitive Neuroscience**
    * The **Scientific** Study of **Biological Substrates** underlying Cognition
        * (Neural Basis of Mental Processes)
    * Possible **Levels of Analysis**:
        - Genes, Bio/Neuro, Cognitive, Behavior, Enviroment
    * What is: **Reductionism** and why is it hazardous?
        - **Reductionism**: Explaining complex set of facts, entities, phenomena, or structures by a simpler set.
        - Ignores **Emergent Properties**
            - _Unique features_ that _emerge_ when _parts combine_/interact.
            - **Gestaltic**: Whole is greater than the sum of its parts
- **The Nueron**
    * The **Basic Unit** of the **Brain**
        - Nueron **transmits electrical signals** from one location to another in the nervous system
        - **Greatest concentration** of neurons in the **Neocortex**
        - The brain is complex **cellular system** of:
            * 10^11 nuerons
            * 10^14 synaptic connections
            * 10^12 = 1 Trillion, 10^15 = 1 Quadrillion
        -  Brain = ~100 Billion Nuerons
    * **Parts of** the **Neuron**
        - **Soma**
            * **Cell body** containing the **nucleus**
            * **Integrates** info **from Dendrites**
        - **Dendrites**
            * The Branches **extending from the Soma**
            * **Dendrites recieve** information from other neurons (via Axons)
        - **Axon**
            * **Long thin tube**, extends from soma which responds to info
            * Information **Transmitter**
            * **Axon Terminal**:
                - **Buttons** at the **ends of the axon**
                - **Releases Neurotransmitters**
            * **Synapse** (Synaptic Cleft)
                - Junctions between axons and dendrites
            * **Two Kinds of Axons**
                - **Myelinated**: 
                    * Surrounded by the **myelin** (a white fatty substance) surrounding
                    * Has a mylin sheath: Insluates and protects longer axons from electrical interference
                        - Also speeds up conduction of information
                    * **Nodes of Ranvier**: small gaps in myelin coating serving to increase conduction speed
                - **Un-Myelinated**: 
                    * Typically **shorter** and **smaller**
                    * No myelin surrounding
        - **Terminal Button**
            * **Small knobs** found at **ends of branches** of **axon**
            * **Do not directly touch** the dendrites of next neuron
        - **Synapse**
            * **Small gaps** between terminal buttons of one or more neurons
            * Important in cognition -- more synapses in learning
            * Decreased synapses associated with Alzheimers

                * (bone, blood, brain, cebrospinal fluid)
            - Produces **9-12 image "slices"** at different depths for 3-D image

                    - E.g Violin players: larger area of R hemisphere (controls left hand)
            - Better contrast that CAT, no ionzing radiation
            - Magnets preclude metal in body (pacemakers)
                * Must lie still in small tunnel
                * Expensive

                - More **active regions consume more glucose** (and oxygen)
                - **Subtraction Method**: Activity during **generalized task** - during **task of interest**
                - **High IQ** linked to **less glucose use on cog. demanding tasks** (_efficeincy_)
            * **Disadvantages**:

        - **SPEC** (Single-Photon Emission Computed Tomography) 
            - Similar but **cheaper than PET**
            - Now one of **most popular** ways to **study brain activation**
            - Measures changes in _magnetic properties_ of blood as **hemoglobin becomes deosygenated**
                * **Like PET** but **no radioactive particles**
                * Magnet induces **changes in oxygen atoms**
                * Shows areas with less oxygen (i.e consumed)
            - Brain areas with more _blood flow_ have **better visibility on MRI images**
                * Correlates with brain activation during a task
            - **Less invasive & higher temporal resolution than PET**

    * Intelligence and Brain Size
        - Modest but signifigant + relation
            * Only correlational data
                - Association doesn't tell us casual diretionality
        - Femals: Frontal lobe gray matter matters
        - Males: Posterior ray matter matters more
    * Intelligence and Neurons
        - Conduction velocity may be + associated
    * Intelligence and Brain Metabolism
        - Efficiency: smarter consume less glucose?
            * Controversial: other studies show opposite (more glucose consumed)
    * Biological bases of Intelligence Testing
        - IQ Tests: Over-focus on _crystallized_ (posterior) vs. _fluid_ intelligence
            * Goal setting, planning, reasoning, problem-solving (frontal, temporal lobes)
    * The P-FIT theory of intelligence
        - Parieto-frontal integration theory
        - Extrastriate cortex and fusionform gyrus
            * Recogniton, imagrery, and eleboration of visual input
    * (Executive Functions) : 
        - Only Working Memory, attentional control, Bx Inhibition, Planning, Monitoring
