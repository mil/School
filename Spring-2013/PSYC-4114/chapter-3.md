Chapter 3 -- Perception
=======================
* **Definition**:
    - Complex process of recognizing, organizing, and interpreting sensory info
    - And how we attach meaning to it
* **Modalities**:
    - Examples:
        - Visual(sight)
        - Auditory(hearing)
        - Olfactory(smell)
        - Haptic(touch)
        - Gustatory(taste)
    - **Distal Object**: The actual stimulus in external World
    - **Informaiton Medium**: Energy pattern imposed by stimulus
        * Reflecte dlight, sound waves, chemical molecules, mechinal pressure, vibration
    - **Proximal Stimulation**: Of sensory rectors by info medium.:
        * What you sense (sensation) is not same as what you percieve
        * e.g: photon absorption on retina rods and cones
            - Proximal stimulus is the retinal image
            - Only 2-dimensional
                * Also upside down, left-right reverse, and changes with movement...
                    - not what we percieve
    - **Percept**: Meaningful interpretation of proximal stimulus
        * What we actually "see", "hear", "taste", "smell", "feel"
        * Influenced by prior knowledge
        * We percieve a distal object as _constant_, desptire changing proximal stimulation
            - Basaed on expecation of invariant relations among objects in the enviroment
