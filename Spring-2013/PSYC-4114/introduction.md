Introduction to Cognitive Psychology
====================================
- **What is Cognitive Psychologists?**
    * Study of how people
        - Percieve
        - Learn
        - Remeber
        - Think about Information
    * Involves a variety of mental processes
        - Memory, Attention, Language, Problem Solving
        - Decision Making, Reading
- **Dialectic Progression** of Ideas
    * Thesis
        - Statement of opinion or belief
        - e.g: "Biology determines human nature"
            * (early 20th century view)
    * Antithesis
        - Counterstatement
        - e.g: "The enviroment determines human nature"
            * (1960s)
    * Synthesis
        - Integrates most credible features
        - (best of both views)
        - "Nature and nurture _interact_ to determine human nature"
        - (modern view)
- **Roots of (Cognitive) Psychology**
    * A teacher and his student disagree...
    * **Rationalism** (Plato)
        - Logic & Reasoning is key to knowledge/truth
        - Descartes
            * Cogito, ergo sum
            * Senses can decieve. Knowledge comes from reason & math
    * **Empiricism** (Aristotle)
        - Experience & Observatoin is key
        - Physiology: emperical study of body functions
        - Locke
            * Knowledge comes from sensory experience (evidence)
            * "Tabula Rosa" -- Blank Slate
    * **Synthesis**: Transcendental Idealism
        - Kant's modern view
        - Reason without experience is empty, devoid of any content
            * and yet experience without reason and thought is blind
        - Both experience & reason have a role
- **Other Roots of (Cognitive) Psychology**
    * **Strucuralism**
        - Wundt & Tichener
        - "Elements" of the mind
        - 1st major school of thought in psychology
        - Classify structures (content) of the mind (sesnsations, thoughts), how they interact
        - **Introspection**
            * Think aloud, empericst method
    * **Functionalism**
        - James & Dewey
        - "Process" (vs. content of mind)
        - What we do with the mind, how, and why
        - Pragmatisim 
        - But didn't specify how learning happens
    * **Synthesis**: Associationism
        - How events/ideas become associated with one another in the mind via learning
        - **Aristotle**
            * Contiguity (close in time)
            * Similarity (similar features)
            * Contract (polarity, e.g hot/cold, day/night)
        - **Ebbinghaus**
            * Use Self-Observation
                - (Memory for nonsense syllables, RT & errors)
            * Study of learning by rehersa
                - (Concious repetition)
        - **Thorndike**
            * Law of Effect
                - We learn "effects" (volunrary responses)
                - via "satifsfactions" (rewards)
                - (e.g. soling math problems for treats)
- **Association and Behaviorism**
    * **Associationism**
        - (Thorndike)
        - Satisfaction/Law of Effect
    * **Behaviorism**
        - (Pavlov)
        - "Contingency"
        - Extreme associasism (enviro-behavior)
        - Make presence of food (US) contigent on presence of bell (CS) -> CR
        - Classical Conditiong - Involuntary learning
        - Contiguit (temporal) + contigency (US with cS)
    * **Synthesis**: Radical Behaviorism
        - We can only observe and thus study the enciroment (input)
        - and behavior (output), non unobservable mental processes (mind = the black box)
