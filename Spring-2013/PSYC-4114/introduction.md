Introduction to Cognitive Psychology
====================================
- **What is Cognitive Psychologists?**
    * Study of how people
        - Percieve
        - Learn
        - Remeber
        - Think about Information
    * Involves a variety of mental processes
        - Memory, Attention, Language, Problem Solving
        - Decision Making, Reading
- **Dialectic Progression** of Ideas
    * Thesis
        - Statement of opinion or belief
        - e.g: "Biology determines human nature"
            * (early 20th century view)
    * Antithesis
        - Counterstatement
        - e.g: "The enviroment determines human nature"
            * (1960s)
    * Synthesis
        - Integrates most credible features
        - (best of both views)
        - "Nature and nurture _interact_ to determine human nature"
        - (modern view)
- **Roots of (Cognitive) Psychology**
    * A teacher and his student disagree...
    * **Rationalism** (Plato)
        - Logic & Reasoning is key to knowledge/truth
        - Descartes
            * Cogito, ergo sum
            * Senses can decieve. Knowledge comes from reason & math
    * **Empiricism** (Aristotle)
        - Experience & Observatoin is key
        - Physiology: emperical study of body functions
        - Locke
            * Knowledge comes from sensory experience (evidence)
            * "Tabula Rosa" -- Blank Slate
    * **Synthesis**: Transcendental Idealism
        - Kant's modern view
        - Reason without experience is empty, devoid of any content
            * and yet experience without reason and thought is blind
        - Both experience & reason have a role
- **Other Roots of (Cognitive) Psychology**
    * **Strucuralism**
        - Wundt & Tichener
        - "Elements" of the mind
        - 1st major school of thought in psychology
        - Classify structures (content) of the mind (sesnsations, thoughts), how they interact
        - **Introspection**
            * Think aloud, empericst method
    * **Functionalism**
        - James & Dewey
        - "Process" (vs. content of mind)
        - What we do with the mind, how, and why
        - Pragmatisim 
        - But didn't specify how learning happens
    * **Synthesis**: Associationism
        - How events/ideas become associated with one another in the mind via learning
        - **Aristotle**
            * Contiguity (close in time)
            * Similarity (similar features)
            * Contract (polarity, e.g hot/cold, day/night)
        - **Ebbinghaus**
            * Use Self-Observation
                - (Memory for nonsense syllables, RT & errors)
            * Study of learning by rehersa
                - (Concious repetition)
        - **Thorndike**
            * Law of Effect
                - We learn "effects" (volunrary responses)
                - via "satifsfactions" (rewards)
                - (e.g. soling math problems for treats)
- **Association and Behaviorism**
    * **Associationism**
        - (Thorndike)
        - Satisfaction/Law of Effect
    * **Behaviorism**
        - (Pavlov)
        - "Contingency"
        - Extreme associasism (enviro-behavior)
        - Make presence of food (US) contigent on presence of bell (CS) -> CR
        - Classical Conditiong - Involuntary learning
        - Contiguit (temporal) + contigency (US with cS)
    * **Synthesis**: Radical Behaviorism
        - We can only observe and thus study the enciroment (input)
        - and behavior (output), non unobservable mental processes (mind = the black box)
        - Watson: "Give me 12 Infants", Little Albert
- **Experimental Studies**
    * Random sample of participants
    * Manipulate the **independent** variable (IV)
        - Create **experiemntal** group & a **control** group
    * **Randomly assign** participants
    - Measure the **dependent** variable (DV)
    - Control all other variables
- **Typical Dependent Varibales**
    * Reaction Time (milliseconds)
        - Mental events take time
    * Accuracy/Error Analysis
        - How well the participant does on a task
    * What trade off occurs between these variables?
        - What happens to your error rate if you go too fast?
- Correlational Studies
    * Simply measure 2 (or more) variables of interest and calculate correlation.
        - Does X relate to Y? If so, _how_?
            * Most common: Pearson product-moment r (actually developed by Francis Galton)
                - Example: x = test anxiety, y = text scores (exam performance)
    * Direction of relationship: **sign** of "r"
        - What does positive vs. negative look like?
    * Strength of (linear) relationship: **size** of "r"
        - What does strong vs. weak look like?
        - Meaning if **signifigant** (p < .05)?
    * Limitation : Correlation does not imply causation!
    * Casual Directionality: Does Delta X lead to Delta Y, or Delta Y to Delta X?
        - There is no IV and DV
    * Third Variable Problem & Spurious Correlation
        - Confound: Unmeasured variable affects rxv
            * E.g Z = time spent revising answers
            * Z may increase test scores & lower anxiety
            * Controlling for Z may drop rxv to zero
            * e.g Ice cream sales & public pool drownings
    * So why not do _only_ experiments?
        * Pros: control confounds, **internal validity** (casual inference)
        * Cons: Feasibility, ethics, **ecological validity**
            - Relecance of findings in different enviromental contexts
    * Example of a Correlational Cognitive Study
        - Relationship between **confidence** and **acuracy** of eyewitness in identifying perpetrators
- Confidence vs. Knowledge
    * How well do you know what you know (or don't know)?
    * Does this level of confidence predict accuracy?
        - "I attended every lecture, read the chapters several times, and thought I did pretty well on the exam but..."
    * Familiarity/understanding vs. Knowing
        - Comprehension vs. Production
    * Students who do well are beter at:
        - KNowing what they know (and don't know)
        - Mastering what they don't know
    * How to get there:
        - **Distributed vs. massed practice**
        - **Test yourself along the way**
            * **Gnerating** vs **reviewing**
        - **Seek critical feedback**
- Psychobiological Studies
    * **Postmortem studies**
        - Examine the cortex of deceased people who experienced reading disability
    * **Brain-damed** individuals and their deficits
    * Monitor **brain physiology** participants doing a cognitive task
- Self Report Studies
    * **Verbal Protocol**
        - Participants describe their consious thorughts while solving a story problem
    * **Diary Study**
- Naturalistic Observation
    * Detailed study of congition in everyday (non-laboratory) situations
    * Useful for hypothesis formulation (vs. testing)
        - Monitor decision making of pilots during flights
