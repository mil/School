A neceessary and sufficient descriptive analysis of what "science" would be ideal. If you had such an analysis, you would also be able to answer of me the question:  what is not science?

    %p Paul Feyerabend in <i>Against Method</i> paints a picture of science as being a fundamentally anarchistic practice. This view of science at its time was a radical departure from pictures of science painted by philosophers of science such as Popper. The key difference in Feyerabend's picture and
