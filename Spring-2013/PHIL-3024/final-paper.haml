    #title Programming in Defence of Epistemological Anarchism
    %p Epistemological Anarchism is the theory within the philosophy of science that asserts that there are no established specific methodological rules that progress science or grow our epistemic knowledge. The phrase "anything goes", as offered by epistemological anarchism's biggest proponent, Paul Feyerabend, captures this essence.  Epistemological anarchism does not assert that science's methodology is flawed, but rather that traditional scientific methodology is limited in view and need not be strictly adhered to. Adherence to specific methodology or sets of principles in epistemic activity ultimately serves to inhibit progress by specifying ends to which means sought out.  Epistemological Anarchy calls for a wider notion of what could be considered scientific by liking Science to a ideology (which simply embraces particular methodology). If we choose to accept that science should be indeed likened to an ideology, as epistemological anarchism advocates, advancements on the internet could be seen as incorporating scientific ideology alongside differing ideologies and methodologies. 
    %p Overview aside, I will now provide a brief roadmap of how I will explore the application of epistemological anarchism to the Internet. In (I), I will explore some of the primary motivations for epistemological anarchy advocating the likening of science to an ideology. Proceeding in (II), I will offer a overview of the Internet and how ideologies might be applied to particular wpublished works on the Internet. In (III), with my grounding estblashed in (I)-(II), I will present my argument for the acceptance of science as an ideology . Concluding in (IV)-(V), I will additional support and refute potential counter-argumentation to my argument offered in (III).
    %h2 II. Motivations for Epistemological Anarchism
    %p Epistemological Anarchism suggest that Science should be likened to an ideology rather than a strict and rigid methodology that may be adhered to as it is often viewed in education and academia. Establishing the motivations for why it is appropriate to liken science to an ideology or a culture will be my concern through this section. I will present two primary motivations for the acceptance of science as an ideology concerning: the problem of the presupposition of realism in science and 
    %h2 I.<sub>I</sub> The Problem of the Presupposition of Realism in Science
    %p  Realism is the concept that there is an objective and shared reality that the world exhibits.  Science as a whole presupposes a sense of realism regarding the observation of phenomena in our world. The scientific method calls for a descriptive, repeatable, and testable analsysis grounded on the assumption of such realism.  To the scientific realists, if a man were to drop a pen, we would grant that it was directly observable to the man that the pen fell through the air and <i>scientifically</i> we could reference the theoretical entity gravity to explain why this phenomenon occurred.
    Making the jump between the directly observable and descriptive phenomena of the pen dropping and giving explanation or the <i>justification</i> by which the theoretical entity gravity explains reality is the starting point for science's major fault. Presupposition of realism regarding observation of the world extends to theorteical entities often in scientific work. We search for the correct theoretical theories, such as "gravity". Such theoretical entities rooted in justifaction extrapolated from directly observable phenomana from a realist persepctive simply cannot stand aside the nature by which human reasoning facilitates justification. Why? Justification is fundamentally non-realist and idealistic in its nature.
    %p How do we use language to facilitate justification of the phenomena we observe in the world to thus produce epistemic knowledge?  If science aims to work us toward the real truth about the world, we should be able to explain <i>what</i> the theories science gives are true in virtue <i>of</i> or <i>how</i> they may be <i>justified</i>. To explore this line of inquiry, first we must understand how knowledge may be understood at its most base level. The commonly asserted descriptive analysis of knowledge within epistemology is known as the Justified True Belief (JTB) analysis of knowledge. JTB asserts that in order for some subject S to know some proposition P, two criterion must be fulfilled:
    %ol
      %li S is justified in believing that P is true
      %li S's belief in P is true
    %p Within epistemology, the Regress problem arises from the JTB analysis of knowledge. The regress problem shows that defining knowledge in context to justification results in an ad-infinitum regress of justified true beliefs. Consider the following illustration of the regress problem.
    %ol
      %li A, B, and C are justified true beliefs 
      %li A is justified by B
      %li B is justified by C
      %li C must be justified by another justified true belief
      %li ...A regress of justified true beliefs continues on ad-infinitum since something we may be said to <i>know</i> must be always justified.
    %p A number of "solutions" to the regress problem have been proposed by epistemologists which largely fall into one of two camps: foundationalism and coherentism.  Foundationalists assert that all epistemological knowledge is grounded in "basic" or "foundational" beliefs. These "basic" beliefs are a priori justified or self-justified and thus the JTB criteria for knowledge does not apply at the "bedrock" of our epistemology. Cognitive giveness is one example of a criteria of a "basic belief" argued by foundationalists as self-justifying the bedrock of our knowledge. For example, if a subject observed a red door and formed the belief "the door is red", it would seem absurd to provide further justification to such belief. The belief "the door is red" might be classified as "cognitivly given" by the foundationalist and need no further justification. An alternative to the foundationalism, coherentism solves the regress problem by asserting that all JTBs exist within a coherent system of beliefs and the linear style justification assumed by the regress problem is flawed. As such, depending your context and flavour of coherentism, the regress problem is largely viewed as nothing more than a psuedo-problem. For the coherentist, seeing a red door and forming the belief "the door is red" might be part of a much larger and grander set of "coherent" beliefs involving beliefs about: the color red, the subject's mental disposition, the concept of a door, and so on and so forth. Coherentism can be liked to a holistic or gestaltic view of justification in which justification and knowledge may not always be exposed descriptively at face value.
    %p The very existence of the regress problem and its "solutions" point at something very interesting about <i>human reasoning</i>: its basis is fundamentally idealistic. Returning to the example of the red door, imagine two men in a room with a red door and one of the men asserts the proposition "the door is red". The other man in the room can either agree or disagree with the proposition at hand. Perhaps the man disagrees that the door is red and then provides reasons why he holds his view as such. Contrarily, perhaps the man accepts the proposition and then provides reasons for his acceptance. In either case, from an outside, observational, or realistic perspective we cannot use our <i>reason</i> to why the external epistemic agent accepted or denied the claim objectively. Why does one man think one way and another think another way? What is the method for determining the answer to this question or how can we extrapolate <i>others</i> justification? Or to simplify: why would we ever think that science could provide us with <i>the</i> method rather than <i>a</i> method in any such case? Science cannot provide "the" ultimate method because there are simply goals which are un-attainable for science to reach.
    %p Science as a hold aims provide objective <i>justification</i> in a realist persepctive, by asserting there is <i>method</i> to determine the real nature of entities of the world.  Asserting that there are realist method to determine the nature of theoretical entities and provide definite reasons for their justification is just about as absurd as asserting that we could fathom <i>the</i> solution to the regress problem. So long as human beings have the capacity to question and thus disagree with one another, seeking <i>the</i> method for determining the nature of world entities is un-imaginable. A more modest view of science might presuppose that a "true" or "realist" conception of world cannot exist objectively and thus aim to provide "methods" to progress our epistemic knowledge as "best" as possible. However, now the problem now becomes: what will progress our knowledges as "best" as possible? How does one now define "best"? As such, we quickly find ourselves back looking for reasons, stratified and divided by ideology, reminiscent of the regress problem. We find no proper bedrock for our epistemology and we proceed realizing that the notion of a realist conception of the way the world works, as such science aims for, seems unattainable.

    %h2 I.<sub>II</sub> The "Scientific Method" is a Myth
    %p Science is often viewed in respect to society as a compartmentalized knowledge-generating institution upon which our knowledge and epistemology are grounded.  This narrow view of science, leads scientific knowledge to being viewed as superior to non-scientific knowledge which subsequently severely limits how we might in a more lient and broader sense "apply" scientific methodology in practice.  In <i>How to Defend Society Against Science</i>, Paul Feyerabend shows mistaken this idea that knowledge we receive from science is of higher quality merit than "non-scientific" knowledge by questioning the notion that "science" even works via "defined" methodologies.  Consider my following reconstruction of the argument which Feyerabend argues against in the aforementioned article: 
    %ol
      %li Science has finally found the correct method for achieving results.
      %li There are many results to prove the excellence of the method.
      %li Thus: The knowledge we receive from science is of higher quality merit than non-scientific knowledge.
    %p Feyerabend points out that even if (1) were granted and specific "scientific" methodologies could be defined and agreed upon, such result-producing methodologies still would always be fated to the problem of induction. Consider one example methodology by which science may be postulated to operate in which "science works by collecting facts and inferring theories from them" (183). Under this methodology, can it ever be said that theories <i>follow</i> from facts? Suppose one white swan passes by, then another white swan passes by, and then a third white swan passes by. At what point can we infer from our experience universal rules and assume that the world works in a realist or regular way such that we would be able to grant: "all swans are white". This is the classical problem of induction which will remain lingering for science so long as it assumes a realist or "regular fashion" of the way in which the world works. Even without disagreement between subjects on theoretical entities as illustrated in (I.I), induction is buried as a problem for science methodology at its most fundamental level.  It follows that science cannot provide us with answers to "how the world is" but rather scientific methodology can only ever provide us with ideology in the form of methodology for gathering contigent knowledge in regards to "how the world has been so far". 
    %p While science may not have "the" correct method, perhaps we may modify (1) and assert that science has attained <i>a</i> correct method for achieving results". A correct method for achieving results along with (2) might still stand to us being able to conclude (3).  However, Feyerabend dismisses this intuition by rejecting (2) in arguing that science's produced results cannot be said to prove excellence of the scientific method in virtue that (2) may only be granted <i>if it is the case</i> that "nothing else has ever produced results". What Feyerabend is arguing here is that any "un-scientific" methodology producing results serves to disprove's the excellence of scientific methodology producing results. Consider a religious people performing a rain dance who have specific cultural rules and ceremony governing the execution of the rain dance. Perhaps sometimes it rains and sometimes it does not rain when the rain dance is performed. The religious people rain dance's results can be understood as "non-scientific" or merely "less scientific"; while meteorologists calculating the density of the clouds, researching the atmosphere, and so forth could be classified as "scientific" or at least "more scientific". Now, it is imaginable that the religious people may more "accurately" predict the rain then the meteorologists due to numerous factors. Perhaps the meterologists simply do not have the "ideal" theoretical abstractions or entities formulated and as such less acuratly predict the rain then the religious people.  Does this make the religious peoples methodology "better" or "more scientific" than the meterologists? No, not necessarily; the point is the activities the meteorologists and the activities the religious people engage in are not so different. "Science" is not sacred, comparmealized, a dissepature istutition; but rather merely an ideology which stands aside other ideologies, mythologies, religiou, and cultures.
    %p Even if (2) were to be assumed to be true and science's methodology was proven excellent in virtue of its results , that results only prove said excellence in so far as it were <i>only</i> the methodology that were responsible for the results. Isolating specific "scientific methodology" seems like a difficult endeavor and further pulling upon the history of science this seems like an un-sound assumption to operate on. A rigid scientific method by which scientists follow "set" methods without incorporating "non-scientific" thought is an ideal of hardheaded scientific idealists. Feyerabend references the example from the history of Science that when Copernius introduced his view of the universe he did not reference previous scientific theories alone. Rather, Copernicus consulted "a crazy Pythagoreon such as Philoalaos". A "pure" or "true" scientific method would specify all justifications taken in inference of the practice of science, but how does one specify all of those justifications? What about when the scientist ends his day, returns home, eats dinner, non-scientifically has interactions with his wife, and then sleeps and dreams? Are not all these activities part of the "scientific method"? All of these activities could play a part in the ultimate "justification" to which science would need provide to specify a "realist" view of the world.
    %p Science compartmentalizing and govering the demarction of what is "scientific" by asserting to offer correct "methodology" as such is flawed. The scientific method does not aim to capture all activity that is experienced in the scientist's life and as such it follows that Feyerabend asserts that science should be liked to an ideology in lines with mythology, religion, and so on rather than impeccable segregation methodology. Since does not have and could not define rigid isolatable methodology that could be understood as responsible for it's results independently.  Further, even if science had defined methodology, which at its most fundamental level could be understood as merely justification, human reasoning and justification is not grounded in realist, but rather merely idealist notions (as seen in (I.I)). 
    %h2 III. An Overview of Computer Programming
    %p Computer programming can be most broadly defined as the activty of writing code which a computer subsequently interprets to produce some output. What this means is that when you program a computer, you write code that the computer can understand and produce results (taking the form of a number of mediums: visual, sensory, auditory, and so on and so forth). Results in programming are directly tied to the input (or method).  Imagine a very basic program that first prompts you for your name, you enter you name (e.g., Jerry[Enter]), and then subseuqently the program outputs hello and then whatever you inputted for your name (e.g., "Hello Jerry").  In a programming language called Ruby, the described program might look like this:
    %blockquote
      \#!/usr/bin/env ruby
      print "What is your name: "
      name = gets 
      puts "Hello \#{name}"
    %p
      A second key feature of programming is that it takes the form of inquiry through the creation of abstractions. The <i>syntax</i> of any programming language can be though of simply as representing a set of abstractions which may be combined in the activty of "coding" to produce code which the computer can cubseuqntly inerpret. Abstractions vary widely from language to language and the way the syntax may be composed to design abstractions may vary. For any given program a specific output may be accomplished in many different ways by utiliziation of various different abstractions taking the form of varying syntax. In other words, there's always more than one way to do things in programming and like an idealistic view of science from the pistemological anarchist stance, methological pluralism is embraced.

    %h2 III. Central Argument: Programming is Science as Defined by Epistemological Anarchism
    %p Computer Programming is a field that can be understood as applying to Feyerabend's larger context of science in which "anything goes" quite fittingly. Throughout the rest of this paper, I will argue that computer programming is a paradigmatic illustration of what epistemological anarchy defines as science. My central argument is that:
    %ol
      %li Epistemological Anarchy dicates that Science should be construed as is the Ideology of Inquiry
      %li In the Ideology of Inquiry, there are no "correct" methodologies (Anything goes)
      %li Computer programming is the activity of writing code which a computer subsequently interprets to produce results.
      %li In computer programming, any particular result may be accomplished in an infinite number of ways.
      %li Computer programming takes the form of inquiry through the creation of abstractions.
      %li Thus: Computer programming is a paradigmatic illustration of what epistemiological anarchy defines as science.

    %h2 IV. Support for (4): Methodological Pluralism in Programming
    %p In programming, making sense of the "ideal" way to write programs comes down to two major thought-camps: interface-oriented and design-oriented methodologies. Interface-oriented culture dictates that programs have more interoperability, modularity, and compasbility in their use. Design-orieinted programs dictates programs have are the simplest for their users to use, a pragmatic-use element.  
    Which of these thought camps may be understood as the more scientific or progressive research programs? There is not necsarilly an answer to this question however, it may be understood that they are unique and different projects. Normally the design-orieinted culture will argue that a product-like feel to the software makes it so software "feels" polished. Contarily, the "interface-orieinted" culture will argue that you can polish your own "design", all design should remain "compasable".
    %p Further the "interface-oriented" versus "design-orieinted" culture debate comes down to distribute "compiled" versus "source". It is a fundamental difference in use case, however it is nonetheless two divergent directions. 
    
    In the current world view, it is posited that science operates on a clear cut model of rational thought, however this is simply far from the case. Programming is a field in wich rational thought can be rapidly developed. 



    %p The commonplace view is that science advances society's rational thought Someone might argue that programming will never make the same advancements as science simply because all programmers do is work merely in abstractions. 

    %p There is an interesting debate within the philosophy of programming which tries to make sense of the "ideal" way to right programs focused.
    %p A central feature of computer programming is methodological pluralism. There is always more than one way of getting the computer to produce a particular result and as a result there a numerous "development philosophies" within the field of programming. Proceeding I willlook at several paradigmatic examples of the methodological pluralism that can be seein in programming.
    %h2 IV.I The Unix Methodology: Make Programs that Do One Thing Well
    %p An operating system known as UNIX is well known in the field of programming for embracing a particular methodology for program development summed up simply as: "make programs that do one thing well". While methodology is meant in a loose sense. Consider the following explanation of the unix philosophy:
    %blockquote
      The Unix philosophy is not a formal design method. It wasn't handed down from the high fastness of theoretical computer science as a way to produce theorticall perfect softare.... The Unix philosophy is bottom-up, not top-down. it is prgagmatic and grounded in experience.
    %p Basically the idea behind the Unix philosophy is that if programs are designed to only do one thing (and well), any given large program is typically broken into multiple smaller programs along the way. Each program only does one thing well and there is a large amount of code re-use between programs.
    %p An alternative to the UNIX philosophy is the MIT Approach. The MIT Approach emphasizes the completness of the project all and a more "feature-rich" and consistent aspect to programming. Rahter than having a bunch of smaller programs defining a larger program, the MIT Approach suggest that a program should be valued in virtue of completness in contast to its simplicity.

    %h2 V. Objection: Epistemological Anarchism is Self-Defeating
    %p To address the objection of the following nature: 
    %ol
      %li Epistemological Anarchism asserts all knowledge is not justified.
      %li Thus: Epistemological anarchism is not justified.

    %p Adherence to specific methodology or sets of principles in epistemic activity ultimatly serves to inhibit progress.
