    #title Defence of Epistemological Anarchism
    %p Epistemological Anarchism is the theory within the philosophy of science that asserts that there are no established specific methodological rules that progress science or grow our epistemic knowledge. The phrase "anything goes", as offered by epistemological anarchism's biggest proponent, Paul Feyerabend, captures this essence.  Epistemological anarchism does not assert that science's methodology is flawed, but rather that traditional scientific methodology is limited in view and need not be strictly adhered to. Adherence to specific methodology or sets of principles in epistemic activity ultimately serves to inhibit progress by specifying ends to which means sought out.  Epistemological Anarchy calls for a wider notion of what could be considered scientific by liking Science to a ideology (which simply embraces particular methodology). If we choose to accept that science should indeed be likened to an ideology, as epistemological anarchism advocates, new advancements on the internet could be seen as incorporating scientific ideology alongside differing ideologies and methodologies in a broader context than tradtional science.
    %p Overview aside, I will now provide a brief roadmap of how I will explore the application of epistemological anarchism to the Internet. In (I), I will explore some of the primary motivations for epistemological anarchy advocating the likening of science to an ideology. Proceeding in (II), I will offer a overview of the Internet and how ideologies might be applied to particular wpublished works on the Internet. In (III), with my grounding estblashed in (I)-(II), I will present my argument for the acceptance of science as an ideology . Concluding in (IV)-(V), I will additional support and refute potential counter-argumentation to my argument offered in (III).
    %h2 I. Motivations for Epistemological Anarchism
    %p Epistemological Anarchism suggest that Science should be likened to an ideology rather than a strict and rigid methodology that may be adhered to as it is often viewed in education and academia. Establishing the motivations for why it is appropriate to liken science to an ideology or a culture will be my concern through this section. I will present two primary motivations for the acceptance of science as an ideology concerning: the problem of the presupposition of realism in science and 
    %h2 I.<sub>I</sub> The Problem of the Presupposition of Realism in Science
    %p  Realism is the concept that there is an objective and shared reality that the world exhibits.  Science as a whole presupposes a sense of realism regarding the observation of phenomena in our world. The scientific method calls for a descriptive, repeatable, and testable analsysis grounded on the assumption of such realism.  To the scientific realists, if a man were to drop a pen, we would grant that it was directly observable to the man that the pen fell through the air and <i>scientifically</i> we could reference the theoretical entity gravity to explain why this phenomenon occurred.
    Making the jump between the directly observable and descriptive phenomena of the pen dropping and giving explanation or the <i>justification</i> by which the theoretical entity gravity explains reality is the starting point for science's major fault. Presupposition of realism regarding observation of the world extends to theorteical entities often in scientific work. We search for the correct theoretical theories, such as "gravity". Such theoretical entities rooted in justifaction extrapolated from directly observable phenomana from a realist persepctive simply cannot stand aside the nature by which human reasoning facilitates justification. Why? Justification is fundamentally non-realist and idealistic in its nature.
    %p How do we use language to facilitate justification of the phenomena we observe in the world to thus produce epistemic knowledge?  If science aims to work us toward the real truth about the world, we should be able to explain <i>what</i> the theories science gives are true in virtue <i>of</i> or <i>how</i> they may be <i>justified</i>. To explore this line of inquiry, first we must understand how knowledge may be understood at its most base level. The commonly asserted descriptive analysis of knowledge within epistemology is known as the Justified True Belief (JTB) analysis of knowledge. JTB asserts that in order for some subject S to know some proposition P, two criterion must be fulfilled:
    %ol
      %li S is justified in believing that P is true
      %li S's belief in P is true
    %p Within epistemology, the Regress problem arises from the JTB analysis of knowledge. The regress problem shows that defining knowledge in context to justification results in an ad-infinitum regress of justified true beliefs. Consider the following illustration of the regress problem.
    %ol
      %li A, B, and C are justified true beliefs 
      %li A is justified by B
      %li B is justified by C
      %li C must be justified by another justified true belief
      %li ...A regress of justified true beliefs continues on ad-infinitum since something we may be said to <i>know</i> must be always justified.
    %p A number of "solutions" to the regress problem have been proposed by epistemologists which largely fall into one of two camps: foundationalism and coherentism.  Foundationalists assert that all epistemological knowledge is grounded in "basic" or "foundational" beliefs. These "basic" beliefs are a priori justified or self-justified and thus the JTB criteria for knowledge does not apply at the "bedrock" of our epistemology. Cognitive giveness is one example of a criteria of a "basic belief" argued by foundationalists as self-justifying the bedrock of our knowledge. For example, if a subject observed a red door and formed the belief "the door is red", it would seem absurd to provide further justification to such belief. The belief "the door is red" might be classified as "cognitivly given" by the foundationalist and need no further justification. An alternative to the foundationalism, coherentism solves the regress problem by asserting that all JTBs exist within a coherent system of beliefs and the linear style justification assumed by the regress problem is flawed. As such, depending your context and flavour of coherentism, the regress problem is largely viewed as nothing more than a psuedo-problem. For the coherentist, seeing a red door and forming the belief "the door is red" might be part of a much larger and grander set of "coherent" beliefs involving beliefs about: the color red, the subject's mental disposition, the concept of a door, and so on and so forth. Coherentism can be liked to a holistic or gestaltic view of justification in which justification and knowledge may not always be exposed descriptively at face value.
    %p The very existence of the regress problem and its "solutions" point at something very interesting about <i>human reasoning</i>: its basis is fundamentally idealistic. Returning to the example of the red door, imagine two men in a room with a red door and one of the men asserts the proposition "the door is red". The other man in the room can either agree or disagree with the proposition at hand. Perhaps the man disagrees that the door is red and then provides reasons why he holds his view as such. Contrarily, perhaps the man accepts the proposition and then provides reasons for his acceptance. In either case, from an outside, observational, or realistic perspective we cannot use our <i>reason</i> to why the external epistemic agent accepted or denied the claim objectively. Why does one man think one way and another think another way? What is the method for determining the answer to this question or how can we extrapolate <i>others</i> justification? Or to simplify: why would we ever think that science could provide us with <i>the</i> method rather than <i>a</i> method in any such case? Science cannot provide "the" ultimate method because there are simply goals which are un-attainable for science to reach.
    %p Science as a hold aims provide objective <i>justification</i> in a realist persepctive, by asserting there is <i>method</i> to determine the real nature of entities of the world.  Asserting that there are realist method to determine the nature of theoretical entities and provide definite reasons for their justification is just about as absurd as asserting that we could fathom <i>the</i> solution to the regress problem. So long as human beings have the capacity to question and thus disagree with one another, seeking <i>the</i> method for determining the nature of world entities is un-imaginable. A more modest view of science might presuppose that a "true" or "realist" conception of world cannot exist objectively and thus aim to provide "methods" to progress our epistemic knowledge as "best" as possible. However, now the problem now becomes: what will progress our knowledges as "best" as possible? How does one now define "best"? As such, we quickly find ourselves back looking for reasons, stratified and divided by ideology, reminiscent of the regress problem. We find no proper bedrock for our epistemology and we proceed realizing that the notion of a realist conception of the way the world works, as such science aims for, seems unattainable.

    %h2 I.<sub>II</sub> The "Scientific Method" is a Myth
    %p Science is often viewed in respect to society as a compartmentalized knowledge-generating institution upon which our knowledge and epistemology are grounded.  This narrow view of science, leads scientific knowledge to being viewed as superior to non-scientific knowledge which subsequently severely limits how we might in a more lient and broader sense "apply" scientific methodology in practice.  In <i>How to Defend Society Against Science</i>, Paul Feyerabend shows mistaken this idea that knowledge we receive from science is of higher quality merit than "non-scientific" knowledge by questioning the notion that "science" even works via "defined" methodologies.  Consider my following reconstruction of the argument which Feyerabend argues against in the aforementioned article: 
    %ol
      %li Science has finally found the correct method for achieving results.
      %li There are many results to prove the excellence of the method.
      %li Thus: The knowledge we receive from science is of higher quality merit than non-scientific knowledge.
    %p Feyerabend points out that even if (1) were granted and specific "scientific" methodologies could be defined and agreed upon, such result-producing methodologies still would always be fated to the problem of induction. Consider one example methodology by which science may be postulated to operate in which "science works by collecting facts and inferring theories from them" (183). Under this methodology, can it ever be said that theories <i>follow</i> from facts? Suppose one white swan passes by, then another white swan passes by, and then a third white swan passes by. At what point can we infer from our experience universal rules and assume that the world works in a realist or regular way such that we would be able to grant: "all swans are white". This is the classical problem of induction which will remain lingering for science so long as it assumes a realist or "regular fashion" of the way in which the world works. Even without disagreement between subjects on theoretical entities as illustrated in (I.I), induction is buried as a problem for science methodology at its most fundamental level.  It follows that science cannot provide us with answers to "how the world is" but rather scientific methodology can only ever provide us with ideology in the form of methodology for gathering contigent knowledge in regards to "how the world has been so far". 
    %p While science may not have "the" correct method, perhaps we may modify (1) and assert that science has attained <i>a</i> correct method for achieving results". A correct method for achieving results along with (2) might still stand to us being able to conclude (3).  However, Feyerabend dismisses this intuition by rejecting (2) in arguing that science's produced results cannot be said to prove excellence of the scientific method in virtue that (2) may only be granted <i>if it is the case</i> that "nothing else has ever produced results". What Feyerabend is arguing here is that any "un-scientific" methodology producing results serves to disprove's the excellence of scientific methodology producing results. Consider a religious people performing a rain dance who have specific cultural rules and ceremony governing the execution of the rain dance. Perhaps sometimes it rains and sometimes it does not rain when the rain dance is performed. The religious people rain dance's results can be understood as "non-scientific" or merely "less scientific"; while meteorologists calculating the density of the clouds, researching the atmosphere, and so forth could be classified as "scientific" or at least "more scientific". Now, it is imaginable that the religious people may more "accurately" predict the rain then the meteorologists due to numerous factors. Perhaps the meterologists simply do not have the "ideal" theoretical abstractions or entities formulated and as such less acuratly predict the rain then the religious people.  Does this make the religious peoples methodology "better" or "more scientific" than the meterologists? No, not necessarily; the point is the activities the meteorologists and the activities the religious people engage in are not so different. "Science" is not sacred, comparmealized, a dissepature istutition; but rather merely an ideology which stands aside other ideologies, mythologies, religiou, and cultures.
    %p Even if (2) were to be assumed to be true and science's methodology was proven excellent in virtue of its results , that results only prove said excellence in so far as it were <i>only</i> the methodology that were responsible for the results. Isolating specific "scientific methodology" seems like a difficult endeavor and further pulling upon the history of science this seems like an un-sound assumption to operate on. A rigid scientific method by which scientists follow "set" methods without incorporating "non-scientific" thought is an ideal of hardheaded scientific idealists. Feyerabend references the example from the history of Science that when Copernius introduced his view of the universe he did not reference previous scientific theories alone. Rather, Copernicus consulted "a crazy Pythagoreon such as Philoalaos". A "pure" or "true" scientific method would specify all justifications taken in inference of the practice of science, but how does one specify all of those justifications? What about when the scientist ends his day, returns home, eats dinner, non-scientifically has interactions with his wife, and then sleeps and dreams? Are not all these activities part of the "scientific method"? All of these activities could play a part in the ultimate "justification" to which science would need provide to specify a "realist" view of the world.
    %p Science compartmentalizing and govering the demarction of what is "scientific" by asserting to offer correct "methodology" as such is flawed. The scientific method does not aim to capture all activity that is experienced in the scientist's life and as such it follows that Feyerabend asserts that science should be liked to an ideology in lines with mythology, religion, and so on rather than impeccable segregation methodology. Since does not have and could not define rigid isolatable methodology that could be understood as responsible for it's results independently.  Further, even if science had defined methodology, which at its most fundamental level could be understood as merely justification, human reasoning and justification is not grounded in realist, but rather merely idealist notions (as seen in (I.I)). 

    %h2 II. Scientific Ideology Applied, Among Other Ideologies, on The Internet
    %p When the notion of science is broadened to be understood more as an ideology rather than a set of rational methodologies, great opportunities for exploration arise. Science as an ideology can be seen taking form on the interent in projects which emphasize certain <i>methodologies</i>, however the methodlogies empahsized in a narrow view of science might not be traditionally undestood as "scientific".
    %p On the Internet, science (in an epistemological anarchist view; as an ideology) takes a free-form approach. As epistemological anarchy encourages, truly "anything goes".  Rather than carefully designed experiemnts, research, and papers centered around theoretical entities which take the form of science, science on the Internet as a methodology can be more broadly applied. Following I will look at two paragdigmatic representations of the epistemological anarchist's notion of science taking form on the Internet: Nemaload (a collaborative effort to replicate the mind in simple nervous system) and Soylent (an uberdrink a curious man has been living on incorporating nutrients needed to replace all foods with a single drink)

    %h2 II.I. Nemaload: Digital Replication of the Mind
    %p Nemaload is a project which seeks to digitally replicate the function of the mind in the simplest nervous system. The project targets the nematode worm which has exactly 302 neurons (compared to humans ~100 billion nuerons) to understand how connections between neurons could be replicated. Nemaload stands for nematode upload because the project ideally seeks to "upload" the nematode's mind to a digital form preserving the worm as immortal as a digital entity. If we can understand and fully model how a basic nematode worm's mind works, then "a zebra fish, then a fruit fly, then a honeybee, then a mouse, then a dog, then a macaque monkey" will be just a matter of time. Eventually possibly we could understand, model, and be able to replicate how infact the human mind itself works.
    %p Nemaload is project that emphasizes scientific ideology, however, it by no means emphasizes merely scientific ideology. David A. Dalrymple, a 22 year old prodigy who entered graduate school at age 14, is the driving force behind Nemaload. On the Nemaload site, Dalrymple has a section entitled "What's the point?" in which he clearly lays out his potentional ideology for the Nemaload project. Along side discussion of how Nemaload might progress neuroscience and data-driven modeling, David note that the ethical implications of potentionally uploading human minds is wide. He notes that Nemaload assumes the philosophy of mind of functionalism in which :if one has reproduce with a sufficient level of accuracy the computational function of a mind, then one has, in fact repoduce td the mind." David further notes that Nemaload will help to "inspire ethicits, philosophers, economics, socilogists and other humanities thinkers to take human uploading more seriously".
    %p More interesting than the philosophical position which Nemaload assumes is how clearly science David recognizes the project's use of science as ideological. The project is described as "an antidisplinary, non-institutional science and tehcnology project" and have a specific section of his site aimed to answer the question of where the project fits ideologically speaking. In a section entitled "What university ar eyou working at? Or is this a startup?", David describes that

    %h2 III. Central Argument: Science may be understood as an ideology
    %p Computer Programming is a field that can be understood as applying to Feyerabend's larger context of science in which "anything goes" quite fittingly. Throughout the rest of this paper, I will argue that computer programming is a paradigmatic illustration of what epistemological anarchy defines as science. My central argument is that:
    %ol
      %li Epistemological Anarchy dicates that Science should be construed as is the Ideology of Inquiry
      %li In the Ideology of Inquiry, there are no "correct" methodologies (Anything goes)
      %li Computer programming is the activity of writing code which a computer subsequently interprets to produce results.
      %li In computer programming, any particular result may be accomplished in an infinite number of ways.
      %li Computer programming takes the form of inquiry through the creation of abstractions.
      %li Thus: Computer programming is a paradigmatic illustration of what epistemiological anarchy defines as science.


    %h2 V. Objection: Epistemological Anarchism is Self-Defeating
    %p To address the objection of the following nature: 
    %ol
      %li Epistemological Anarchism asserts all knowledge is not justified.
      %li Thus: Epistemological anarchism is not justified.

    %p Adherence to specific methodology or sets of principles in epistemic activity ultimatly serves to inhibit progress.
