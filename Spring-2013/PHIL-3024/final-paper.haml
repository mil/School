    #title The Internet: Enabling Epistemological Transparency More than Science
    %p What is science and epistemologically does it provide superior knowledge to non-science? A number of different replies may be given to this question and creating a descriptive analysis of science with necessary and sufficient conditions would seem ideal. If you had such an analysis, showing scientific knowledge as "superior" to non-scientific knowledge would likely be trivial. However, taking a look into the history of science, it becomes clear that providing such necessary and sufficient conditions are not so easy to discern. One critical distinction to take note of is that science is radically different when viewed <i>as a practice</i> in comparison with being viewed <i>as an ideology</i>. Science, as a vague term, is often used in both contexts interchangeably, however this leniency can be credited with massively distorting the our conception of epistemological progress. Turning to Feyerabend's notion of epistemological anarchy, this distortion has lead to science to gain an undeserved position in society. Now, however turn to the Internet, a unregulated communication actualizing the epistemological anarchist dream. 

    %p Building on top of Feyerbend's notion of epistemological anarchism, I will set out to argue that the Internet serves as an epistemological anarchist's playground; enabling a broader notion of "science" than is afforded by traditional standards.  With Feyerabend's epistemological anarchy and my own conception of the Internet presented, I will now proceed to argue that the Internet provides a wider context than science for epsitemological progress by providing a full realization of the potential of epistemological anarchy.

    %h2 I. In Defence of Epistemological Anarchy 
    %p Paul Feyerabend in <i>Against Method</i> presents his conception of epistemological anarchy in which he argues that science is fundamentally an anarchistic practice which has gained an undeserved status in society. Feyerabend argues that epistemological speaking, the knowledge derived from science is no "better" or more grounded than any other kind of knowledge. The reason that Feyerabend argues this is that he views science merely as a methodology. Science should not be viewed as a grandiose methodology progressing the epistemological grounding of society but merely as a radical ideology which has infested society epistemological thought. Attempts to distinguish what is science from what is non-science pokes this hole open quite largely.
    %p Defenders of science when told that scientific knowledge is no better than other kinds of knowledge will likely argue that science's methodology is the fundamental component of its importance and deserved place in society. Regardless, a defneder of science who chooses to argue that science provides us with knowledge or facts superior to non-scientific facts can always undoubtedly be posed the question of: why? At one time it was commonly believed that the Earth was flat. Columbus sailed the ocean and subsequently asserted that the earth was round. When Columbus posed that the Earth was round, he had reason. Was this a scientific reason?  So what is the scientific method?  Further, how can we distinguish science from non-science. Philosophers of science have historically answered this question asserting a few different criteria as being essential to the emperical practice or methodology of science. Now I will consider some of the most popular criterion for demarcation of science and represent Feyerabend's dissmisall of such criteria.
    %p A first criterion that may be seen as necessary for science, as an emperical practice, is verifiability. Verifiability or reproducibility is a feature of emperical science in which the results you have obtained from a given experiment can be <i>reproduced or verified</i> independent of the experimenter. As such, if experimenter A uses B design and receives C results. Another experimenter, A<sub>1</sub>, who sets up B design, should receive C results as well. If the experimenter A<sub>1</sub> does not recieve C results but indeed can follow the method outlined by B design, then the experiment may not be deemed un-scientific but rather the theory will not be accepted. The key component here in classification of one theory as scientific or not to take into account is that verifiability is not verifiability or reproducability of the results, but rather that the method could be reproduced or verified. What is important for a theory to be called scientific under the verfication criteria is merely that it is <i>possible</i> to reproduce and generate the results.
    %p Feyerabend dismisses the verification criteria as being a methodology critical to science arguing that verification is subject to the "logical objection that general statements cannot be derived from singular statments". Logically, this is simply a presentation of the problem of induction. If you see one white swan, then another, then another, at what point can we infer that all swans are white. Logically speaking we are not prima facie justified in such inference. It follows that regardless the number of times or how often a experiment may be reproduced it is not 
    %p Another criteria for the demarction of science which holds more weight than the verification criteria is falsifiabliity. Falsifiability as a criteria for demarcating science was most famously argued favorably by Karl Popper. The critieria of falsifiablity in evaluating emperical scientific practice governs that a theory may be called scientific if and only if both: 1. it falsifies existing thoeries and 2. it is capable of being falsified or disproven. Consider an experiemtner A, who uses design B, produces results C, and thus infers D. D could be called falsifiable under the conditions that another theory, E, could assert ~D. and 
    %p Feyerabend regards the falsifaciton as a method as being better than verification, howver he dismisses falsifability of being naive in terms of methodlogy. When some theory B contradicts and falsifies another theory A. As Feyerabend puts it "one gets the impression, which is characteristic of Aristotelian philosophy, that the laws of nature lie open to us, and that obstinate observations are correctly concieved of as a proof that our theories, but not the methods used by us, are raught with makes" (164) 

    %h2 II. The Internet: An Epistemological Anarchist's Playground 
    %p I will now give a philosophical definition of what I will refer to as the Internet.  In so far as this paper is concerned I will not delve into a detailed technical analysis seeking to understand the operation or engineering of the Internet. Rather, I will merely present a <i>concept</i> of what the Internet as a whole enables for epistemology. The Internet a communication channel enabling global data transfer (inclusive of text, images, video, and other media that can be regularly structured) that is both: 1. free from governmental regulation and 2. widely accessible by the majority of the population. 
    %p This concept of the Internet that there are not restriction on <i>what</i>. As such, there is essentially no defined "method" or ideology that governs the Internet. This is in rash comparison with the methodology argued favorably by the ideology of science. 

    %h2 III. Epistemological Transparency
    %p I will now proceed to introduce my own notion of what is means to be epistemologically transparent. In order to understand my noiton of epistemological transparency, I will first assume the traditional JTB account of knowledge. The traditional descriptive JTB account of knowledge assert that: for any given subject, S, to know the belief that P, two criterion must be fulfilled:
    %ol
      %li S is justified in believing that P is true
      %li S's belief in P is true
    %p The first criteria is of particular interest to us in so far as my conception of epistemological transparency goes. Epistemological transparency is the 




    %h2 III. Argument: The Internet is a More Transparent Epistemological Medium than Science
    %p With Feyerabend's epistemological anarchy and my own conception of the Internet presented, I will now proceed to argue that the Internet provides a wider context than science for epistemological progress by providing a full realization of the potential of epistemological anarchy.
    %ul
      %li Science, as an empirical practice, is a fundamentally epistemologically anarchistic enterprise.
      %li Science as a institution and ideology is governed by methodology and process.
      %li From 1-2: The communication of emperical scientific practice is limited by science as an ideology.
      %li The Internet provides an methodlogical and process free enviroment for epistemological anarchy. 
      %li Thus: The Internet provides a wider context for epistemological progress by providing a full realization of the potentional of epistemological anarchy.
    %h2 The Internet Subsumes 

    %h2 IV. Potential Counter-Arguments
    %p Proceeding, I will introduce a number of potential refutations that may be argued in response to my argument

    %h2 IV.<sub>I</sub> Denial of (1): Science empirically is not a anarchistic enterprise
    %p At face value, an intuitive point that might be made is that science is empirically not an anarchistic practice.
