    #title Programming in Defence of Epistemological Anarchism
    %h2 I. An Introduction to Epistemological Anarchism
    %p Epistemological Anarchism is the theory within the philosohpy of science that asserts that there are no established specific methodological rules that progress our epistemic knowledge in a superior manner. The phrase "anything goes", as offered by epistemological anarchism's biggest proponent, Paul Feyerabend, captures this essence.  Epistemological anararchism does not assert that science's methodology is flawed, but rather that traditonal scientific methodology is limited in view and need not be strictly adhered to. Adherence to specific methodology or sets of principles in epistemic activity ultimatly serves to inhibit progress.

    %p Feyerabend's notion that "anything goes" stands for the idea that all methodologies should be considered and employed in scientific work. As such, epistemological anarchism can be understood as a kind of "methodological pluralism" in constract to the stark and defined metholodigies "science" typically adheres to. The methodologies which Feyerabend views as harmful to "science" are notions such as falsification and reapability. 

    %h2 II. Motivations for Epistemological Anarchism

    %h2 II.<sub>I</sub> The Problem of the Presupposition of Realism in Science
    %p Science as a whole presupposes realism regarding observation of pheonomena in our world.  Realism is the concept that there is an objective and shared reaility that the world exibits. Realism is often put into contrast with idealism which suggests that reality is an isolated manifestation of one's own consiousness.  If a man were to drop a pen, a realist would suggest that it was directly observable to the man that the pen fell through the air and <i>scientifically</i> the realist might then reference the theorethical entity gravity to explain why this phenomenon occured. Making the jump between the directly observable phenomemona of the pen dropping and giving explanation or the <i>justificaon</i> by which the theoretical entity gravity explains reality is the starting point for a major fault which science commits. This fault is that presupposition of realism regarding observation of the world simply cannot stand aside the nature by which human reasoning facitilates justifaciton. 
    %p How do we use language to facilitate justification of the phoenomena we observe in the world to thus produce epistemic knowledge?  If science aims to work us toward the truth about the world, we should be able to explain <i>what</i> the theories science gives are true in virtue <i>of</i> or <i>how</i> they may be justified. To explore this line of inquiry, first we must understand how knowledge may be understood at its most base level. The commonly asserted descriptive analysis of knowledge within epistemology is known as the Justified True Belief (JTB) analysis of knowledge. JTB asserts that in order for some subject S to know some proposition P, two criterion must be fulfilled:
    %ol
      %li S is justified in believing that P is true
      %li S's belief in P is true
    %p Within epistemology, the Regress problem arises from the JTB analsysis of knowledge. The regress problem shows that defining knowledge in context to justification results in an ad-infinitum regress of justified true beliefs. Consider the following illustration of the regress problem.
    %ol
      %li A, B, and C are justified true beliefs 
      %li A is justified by B
      %li B is justified by C
      %li C must be justified by another justified true belief
      %li ...A regress of justified true beleifs continues on ad-infinitum since something we may be said to <i>know</i> must be always further justified.
    %p A number of "solutions" to the regress problem have been proposed by epistemologists which largely fall into two thought-camps: foundationalism and coherentism.  Foundationalists assert that all epistemological knowledge is grounded in "basic" or "foundational" beliefs. These "basic" beliefs are a priori justified and thus the JTB criteria for knowledge does not apply at the "bedrock" of our epistemology. Coginitive giveness is one example of a criteria of a "basic belief" argued by foundationalists as self-justifing the bedrock of our knowledge. For exmaple, if a subject observed a red door and formed the belief "the door is red", it would seem absurd to provide further justification to such belief. Beliefs that are "cognitivly given" need no further justification and as such can be understood as foundational in grounding our knowledge. An alternative to the foundationalism, conheritism solves the regress problem by asserting that all JTBs exist within a coherent system of beliefs and the linear style justification assumed by the regress problem is flawed. As such, depending your context and flavour of coherentism, the regress problem is laregely viewed as nothing more than a psuedo-problem. For the coherentist, seeing a red door and forming the belief "the door is red" might be part of a much larger and grander set of "coherent" beliefs involving beliefs about: the color red, the subject's mental disposition, the concept of a door, and so on and so forth. Coherntism can be liked to a holistic or gestaltic view of justificatoin in which justification and knowledge may not always be viewed descriptivly at face value.
    %p The very existence of the regress problem and its "solutions" point at something very interesting about <i>human reasoning</i>: its basis is fundamentally idealistic. Returning to the example of the red door, imagine two men in a room with a red door and one of the men asserts the proposition "the door is red". The other man can either agree or disagree with the proposition at hand. Perhaps the man disagrees that the door is red and then provides reasons why he denies as such. Contarily, perhaps the man accepts the proposition and then provides reasons for his acceptance. In either case, from an outside, observational, or realistic perspective we cannot use our <i>reason</i> to why he accepted or denied the claim. Why does one man think one way and another think another way? What is the method for determining the answer to this question or how can we extrapolate <i>others</i> justification? Or to simplify: why would we ever think that science could provide us with <i>the</i> method rather than <i>a</i> method in any such case? 
    %p This problem of science aiming to provide objective <i>justification</i> is a large barrier to cross.  The aim of science asserts that there is <i>method</i> to determine the real nature of entities of the world providing adueute justifications. Asserting that there is any realist method to determine the nature of theoretical entities and provide definite reasons for their justification is just about as absurd as asserting that we could fathom <i>the</i> solution to the regress problem. So long as human being have the capacity to question and thus disagree with one another, seeking <i>the</i> method for determining the nature of world entities is un-imaginable. A more modest view of science might presuppose that a "true" or "realist" conception of world cannot exist objectivly and thus aim to provide "methods" to progress our epistemic knowledge as "best" as possible. The problem now becomes: what will progress our knowledges as "best" as possible? How does one now define best? As such, we quickly find ourselves back looking for reasons, reminiscent of the regress problem. We find no proper bedrock for our epistemology and we proceed realizing that the notion of a realist vision of the way the world works seems unattainable.

    %h2 I.<sub>II</sub> Scienctific Methodology is Merely Ideology
    %p Science provides us with a set of methodologies which aim to help us better understand the world from a realist's persepctive. As such, science is largely understood not as an ideology for how we should go about understanding the world but as <i>the</i> methodology for how we understand the world. As such, science is often viewed as a compartmentalized knowledge-generating insitution upon which society's epistemology is grounded.  This places scienctific knowledge as being superior in a way to non-scientific knowledge and thus severly limits how we may understand the justification of knowledge as a whole.  In <i>How to Defend Society Against Science</i>, Paul Feyerabend shows mistaken the idea that knowledge we receive from science is of higher quality merit than "non-scientific" knowledge by questioining the notion that "science" even works via "defined" methodology.  Consider my following reconstruction of the argument which Feyerabend argues against in the article at hand: 
    %ol
      %li Science has finally found the correct method for achieving results.
      %li There are many results to prove the excellence of the method.
      %li Thus: The knowledge we receive from science is of higher quality merit than non-scientific knowledge.
    %p Feyerabend attacks (1) by questioning that there is in fact a specific correct method of science by which results are achieved. Feyerabend hints that the problem of induction remains a barrier for any epistemological progress of proposed scientific methods. Because of the problem of induction, scientific theories always remain unsatisfactory in terms of describing in any strict logical sense "how the world is", rather scientific theories merely can only ever answer the question of "how the world has been so far". In other words, our science cannot produce laws such as "all ravens are black" while supporting the occurence of a grey raven.  It follows that science can only provide us with theories and the success of any particular theory is simply in reference to building upon previously established theories. Practically speaking this results in realizing that our science is not grounded nor can provide us with "facts" but rather may only provide us with knowledge contingent on mere observation.
    %p Feyerabend also attacks (2) by arguing that science's produced results cannot be said to prove the excellence of the scientific method because (2) may only be granted if it is the case that "nothing else has ever produced results". If methodology that was unconventional or obviously seemed non-scientific produced results, then the unconventional or non-scientific method would prove the excellence of this method as well. For example, consider a pepole of an unidustrialized village performing a rain dance who have specific cultural rules and ceremony surrounding the rain dance. Mystisic, religious, and cultural ceremony and process can produce results just as science does however it does not prove the excellence of the methodology just as science's results does not speak of any importance in reference to science's methodology.
    %p Additionally, Feyerabend notes that even if (2) were to be assumed to be true, results would only prove the excellence of methodology in so far as <i>only</i> the methodology were responsible for the results. Isolating specific just sciengtific methodology seems like a diffucult endeavor and further pulling upon the history of science, antecedotal does not support this ideology. A rigid scientific method by which scientists follow "set" methods without incorporating "non-scientific" thought is an ideal of hardheaded scientific idealists. Feyerabend references the example from the history of Science that when Copernius introduced his view of the universe he did not reference previous scientific theories alone. Rahter, Copernicus consulted "a crazy Pythagoreon such as Philoalaos".
    %p After attacking and showing that (3) does not follow from (1) &amp; (2), Feyerabend asserts that science should be liked to an ideology in lines with mythology or religion. Since there is no determined method for which science strictly prescribes to, it is not science that is responsible for results independntly but science is merely an ideology rather than an methodology for epistemological disovery. Understanding the science is just an ideology (an ideolpoy <i>of</i> methodology), science is not in sole repsonsible for epistemology progress. Rather, a number of different thoughts and ideologies may feed into the epistemological results and knowledge thought to be produced by science. What we conclude froms this is that science, epistemologically speaking, is an anarchistic practice.

    %h2 II. Methodological Pluralism and Progarmming
    %p Computer programming is a field which <i>can</i> understood as scientific. A field of study known as computer science seeks to understand the <i>science</i> behind the way computers works. In this field, methodology is employed in the development of algorithms such as [] . While the field of prograaming has been advanced by traditonal scientific practice, more interesting in an exploration of epistemological anarchism is progressions to the field of programming that have been advanced by practinoners outside of science. While these practiniors are not traditional scientists, in that they did not follow strict scientific methodology, if we assume a wider context of "science", free of methodology, in lines with epistemological anarchism these practiniors are just as much scientists as traditoinal scientists writing papers and following strict methodology.

    %h2 III. Argument: The Internet is a More Transparent Epistemological Medium than Science
    %p With Feyerabend's epistemological anarchy and my own conception of the Internet presented, I will now proceed to argue that the Internet provides a wider context than science for epistemological progress by providing a full realization of the potential of epistemological anarchy.
    %ol
      %li Science, as an empirical practice, is a fundamentally epistemologically anarchistic enterprise.
      %li Science as a institution and ideology is governed by methodology and process.
      %li From 1-2: The communication of emperical scientific practice is limited by science as an ideology.
      %li The Internet provides an methodlogical and process free enviroment for epistemological anarchy. 
      %li Thus: The Internet provides a wider context for epistemological progress by providing a full realization of the potentional of epistemological anarchy.
    %h2 The Internet Subsumes 

    %h2 IV. Potential Counter-Arguments
    %p Proceeding, I will introduce a number of potential refutations that may be argued in response to my argument

    %h2 IV.<sub>I</sub> Denial of (1): Science empirically is not a anarchistic enterprise
    %p At face value, an intuitive point that might be made is that science is empirically not an anarchistic practice.
