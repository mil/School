    #title Defence of Epistemological Anarchism
    %p Epistemological Anarchism is a theory within the philosophy of science that asserts that there are no established specific methodological rules that progress science or grow our epistemic knowledge in a superior fashion. The phrase "anything goes", as offered by epistemological anarchism's biggest proponent, Paul Feyerabend, captures this essence.  Epistemological anarchism does not assert that science's methodology is flawed, but rather that traditional scientific methodology is limited in view and need not be strictly adhered to. Adherence to specific methodology or sets of principles in epistemic activity ultimately serves to inhibit progress by specifying ends to which means sought out.  Epistemological Anarchy calls for a wider notion epistemology activity in hopes of progress by likening science to a ideology (which simply embraces particular methodology). The Internet provides an interesting vehicle for understanding epistemological anarchism because the epistemic production of knowledge on the Internet takes places in an epistemic "anything goes" enviroment.  Accepting epistmological anarchism, epistemic activity facilitated throught the Internet can be seen to exhibit "scientific" ideology among numerous other ideologies.
    %p Overview aside, I will now provide a brief roadmap of my application of epistemological anarchism to the Internet. In (I), I will explore some of the primary motivations for epistemological anarchism advocating the likening of science to an ideology. Proceeding in (II), I will offer a overview of the Internet and how ideologies might be applied to particular published works on the Internet. In (III), with my grounding estblashed in (I)-(II), I will present my argument for why epistmic activity facilitated through the Internet should be understood as epistmological anarchy.  Concluding in (IV)-(V), I will offer additional support and refute potential counter-argumentation to my argument offered in (III).


    %h2 I. Motivations for Epistemological Anarchism
    %p Epistemological Anarchism is motivated by realizing science's undeserved place and status in society.  Epistmological Anarchism suggests that science should be likened to an ideology rather than being viewed as a strict and rigid set of methodologies that need be adhered to in isolation. The latent assumption Epistmological Anarchism wishes to deny is that: Scienctific knowledge, produced via the scientific method, is of higher quality merit and isolatable from non-scientific knowledge.  Denying this assumption can be supported by two motivations: illustrating the problem of the presupposition of realism in science and understanding that isolatable "scientific methodology" is a myth.

    %h2 I.<sub>I</sub> Realism , Justification, and Human Reasoning
    %p  Realism is the concept that there is an objective and shared reality that the world exhibits.  Science as a whole presupposes a sense of realism regarding the observation of phenomena in our world. The scientific method calls for a descriptive, repeatable, and testable analsysis grounded on the assumption of such realism.  To scientific realists, if a man were to drop a pen, we would grant that it was directly observable to the man that the pen fell through the air and <i>scientifically</i> we could reference the theoretical entity gravity to explain why this phenomenon occurred.
    %p Making the jump between the directly observable and descriptive phenomena of the pen dropping and giving explanation or the <i>justification</i> by which the theoretical entity gravity explains reality is the starting point for a major fault of which science commits. Since science presupposes realism regarding direct observation of the world, this realism is often taken to extend to theorteical entities (e.g., gravity). Sceintists search for the correct theoretical concepts and abstractions such as "gravity", however it is unclear why we might assume these theoretical concepts could be justificed in a realist sense.  Theortical entities need be rooted in justifaction extrapolated from directly observable phenomana. From a realist persepctive, these theoritical entities simply cannot remain sound given the nature by which human reasoning facilitates justification. Why? Justification is fundamentally non-realist and idealistic in its nature.
    %p How do we use language to facilitate justification of the phenomena we observe in the world to produce epistemic knowledge?  If science aims to work us toward the real truth about the world, we should be able to explain <i>what</i> the theories science gives are true in virtue <i>of</i> or <i>how</i> they may be <i>justified</i>. To explore this line of inquiry, first we must understand how knowledge may be understood at its most base level. The commonly asserted descriptive analysis of knowledge within epistemology is known as the Justified True Belief (JTB) analysis of knowledge. JTB asserts that in order for some subject S to know some proposition P, two criterion must be fulfilled:
    %ol
      %li S is justified in believing that P is true
      %li S's belief in P is true
    %p Within epistemology, the Regress problem arises from the JTB analysis of knowledge. The regress problem shows that defining knowledge in context to justification results in an ad-infinitum regress of justified true beliefs. Consider the following illustration of the regress problem.
    %ol
      %li A, B, and C are justified true beliefs 
      %li A is justified by B
      %li B is justified by C
      %li C must be justified by another justified true belief
      %li ...A regress of justified true beliefs continues on ad-infinitum since something we may be said to <i>know</i> must be always justified.
    %p A number of "solutions" to the regress problem have been proposed by epistemologists which largely fall into one of two camps: foundationalism and coherentism.  Foundationalists assert that all epistemological knowledge is grounded in "basic" or "foundational" beliefs. These "basic" beliefs are a-priori justified or self-justified and thus the JTB criteria for knowledge does not apply at the "bedrock" of our epistemology. Cognitive giveness is one example of a criteria of a "basic belief" argued by foundationalists as self-justifying the bedrock of our knowledge. For example, if a subject observed a red door and formed the belief "the door is red", it would seem absurd to provide further justification to such belief. The belief "the door is red" might be classified as "cognitivly given" by the foundationalist and need no further justification. An alternative to the foundationalism, coherentism solves the regress problem by asserting that all JTBs exist within a coherent system of beliefs and the linear style justification assumed by the regress problem is flawed. As such, depending your context and flavour of coherentism, the regress problem is largely viewed as nothing more than a psuedo-problem. For the coherentist, seeing a red door and forming the belief "the door is red" might be part of a much larger and grander set of "coherent" beliefs involving beliefs about: the color red, the subject's mental disposition, the concept of a door, and so on and so forth. Coherentism can be liked to a holistic or gestaltic view of justification in which justification and knowledge may not always be exposed descriptively at face value.
    %p The very existence of the regress problem and its "solutions" point at something very interesting about <i>human reasoning</i>: its basis is fundamentally idealistic. Returning to the example of the red door, imagine two men in a room with a red door and one of the men asserts the proposition "the door is red". The other man in the room can either agree or disagree with the proposition at hand. Perhaps the man disagrees that the door is red and then provides reasons why he holds his view as such. Contrarily, perhaps the man accepts the proposition and then provides reasons for his acceptance. In either case, from an outside, observational, or realistic perspective we cannot use our <i>reason</i> to why the external epistemic agent accepted or denied the claim objectively. Why does one man think one way and another think another way? What is the method for determining the answer to this question or how can we extrapolate <i>others</i> justification? Or to simplify: why would we ever think that science could provide us with <i>the</i> method rather than <i>a</i> method in any such case? Science cannot provide "the" ultimate method because there are simply goals which are un-attainable for our epistmology to reach.
    %p Science as a whole aims to provide objective <i>justification</i> in a realist persepctive, by asserting there is <i>method</i> to determine the real nature of entities of the world.  Asserting that there are realist methods to determine the nature of theoretical entities and provide definite reasons for their justification is just about as absurd as asserting that we could fathom <i>the</i> solution to the regress problem. So long as human beings have the capacity to question and thus disagree with one another, seeking <i>the</i> method for determining the nature of world entities is un-imaginable. A more modest view of science might presuppose that a "true" or "realist" conception of world cannot exist objectively and thus aim to provide "methods" to progress our epistemic knowledge as "best" as possible. However, now the problem now becomes: what will progress our knowledges as "best" as possible? How does one now define "best"? As such, we quickly find ourselves back looking for reasons, stratified and divided by ideology, reminiscent of the regress problem. We find no proper bedrock for our epistemology and we proceed realizing that the notion of a realist conception of the way the world works, as such science aims for, seems unattainable.

    %h2 I.<sub>II</sub> The "Scientific Method" is a Myth
    %p Science is often viewed in respect to society as a compartmentalized knowledge-generating institution upon which our knowledge and epistemology are grounded.  This narrow view of science, leads scientific knowledge to being viewed as superior to non-scientific knowledge which subsequently severely limits how we might in a more lient and broader sense "apply" scientific methodology in epistemic practice.  In <i>How to Defend Society Against Science</i>, Paul Feyerabend shows mistaken this idea that knowledge we receive from science is of higher quality merit than "non-scientific" knowledge by questioning the notion that "science" even works via "defined" methodologies.  Consider my following reconstruction of the argument which Feyerabend argues against in the aforementioned article: 
    %ol
      %li Science has finally found the correct method for achieving results.
      %li There are many results to prove the excellence of the method.
      %li Thus: The knowledge we receive from science is of higher quality merit than non-scientific knowledge.
    %p Feyerabend points out that even if (1) were granted and specific "scientific" methodologies could be defined and agreed upon, such result-producing methodologies still would always be fated to the problem of induction. Consider one example methodology by which science may be postulated to operate in which "science works by collecting facts and inferring theories from them" (183). Under this methodology, can it ever be said that theories <i>follow</i> from facts? Suppose one white swan passes by, then another white swan passes by, and then a third white swan passes by. At what point can we infer from our experience universal rules and assume that the world works in a realist or regular way such that we would be able to grant: "all swans are white". This is the classical problem of induction which will remain lingering for science so long as it assumes a realist or "regular fashion" of the way in which the world works. Even without disagreement between subjects on theoretical entities as illustrated in (I.I), induction is buried as a problem for science methodology at its most fundamental level.  It follows that science cannot provide us with answers to "how the world is" but rather scientific methodology can only ever provide us with ideology in the form of methodology for gathering contigent knowledge in regards to "how the world has been so far". 
    %p While science may not have "the" correct method, perhaps we may modify (1) and assert that science has attained <i>a</i> correct method for achieving results". A correct method for achieving results along with (2) might still stand to us being able to conclude (3).  However, Feyerabend dismisses this intuition by rejecting (2) in arguing that science's produced results cannot be said to prove excellence of the scientific method in virtue that (2) may only be granted <i>if it is the case</i> that "nothing else has ever produced results". What Feyerabend is arguing here is that any "un-scientific" methodology producing results serves to disprove's the excellence of scientific methodology producing results. Consider a religious people performing a rain dance who have specific cultural rules and ceremony governing the execution of the rain dance. Perhaps sometimes it rains and sometimes it does not rain when the rain dance is performed. The religious people rain dance's results can be understood as "non-scientific" or merely "less scientific"; while meteorologists calculating the density of the clouds, researching the atmosphere, and so forth could be classified as "scientific" or at least "more scientific". Now, it is imaginable that the religious people may more "accurately" predict the rain then the meteorologists due to numerous factors. Perhaps the meterologists simply do not have the "ideal" theoretical abstractions or entities formulated and as such less acuratly predict the rain then the religious people.  Does this make the religious peoples methodology "better" or "more scientific" than the meterologists? No, not necessarily; the point is the activities the meteorologists and the activities the religious people engage in are not so different. "Science" is not sacred, comparmealized, a dissepature istutition; but rather merely an ideology which stands aside other ideologies, mythologies, religiou, and cultures.
    %p Even if (2) were to be assumed to be true and science's methodology was proven excellent in virtue of its results , that results only prove said excellence in so far as it were <i>only</i> the methodology that were responsible for the results. Isolating specific "scientific methodology" seems like a difficult endeavor and further pulling upon the history of science this seems like an un-sound assumption to operate on. A rigid scientific method by which scientists follow "set" methods without incorporating "non-scientific" thought is an ideal of hardheaded scientific idealists. Feyerabend references the example from the history of Science that when Copernius introduced his view of the universe he did not reference previous scientific theories alone. Rather, Copernicus consulted "a crazy Pythagoreon such as Philoalaos". A "pure" or "true" scientific method would specify all justifications taken in inference of the practice of science, but how does one specify all of those justifications? What about when the scientist ends his day, returns home, eats dinner, non-scientifically has interactions with his wife, and then sleeps and dreams? Are not all these activities part of the "scientific method"? All of these activities could play a part in the ultimate "justification" to which science would need provide to specify a "realist" view of the world.
    %p Science compartmentalizing and govering the demarction of what is "scientific" by asserting to offer correct "methodology" as such is flawed. The scientific method does not aim to capture all activity that is experienced in the scientist's life and as such it follows that Feyerabend asserts that science should be liked to an ideology in lines with mythology, religion, and so on rather than impeccable segregation methodology. Since does not have and could not define rigid isolatable methodology that could be understood as responsible for it's results independently.  Further, even if science had defined methodology, which at its most fundamental level could be understood as merely justification, human reasoning and justification is not grounded in realist, but rather merely idealist notions (as seen in (I.I)). 
     
    %h2 II. Argument: Science is Part of Epistemological Anarchistic Practice on the Internet
    %p With the motivations for epistemological anarchism developed in (I), I will now proceed to my central argument: 
    %ol
      %li Epistemological anarchistic activity consists of any and all epistemic activity. (Anything Goes)
      %li Scientific methodology is one ideology that may be employed in epistemological anarchistic activity.
      %li The Internet consists of publications of epistemic activity.
      %li Thus: Scientific ideology is part of epistemological anarchistic practice on the Internet.

    %h2 III. Internet Epistemological Anarchistic Projects Incorporating Scientific Ideology
    %p All activity on the Internet is the byproduct of epistemological anarchistic practice. There is no methodology or classification that need be specified to publish epistemic works on the Internet. As such, methodological pluralism as epistemological anarchism suggests is embraced. Among the ideologies that feed into projects on the Internet is the ideology of science. Following I will look at two epistemic projects facilitated through the Internet which embrace science as an ideology in lines with epistemological anarchism.

    %h2 III.<sub>I</sub> Nemaload: Digitally Replicating Minds
    %p Nemaload is a project which seeks to digitally replicate the function of the mind in the simplest possible nervous system. The project seeks to replicate the neural connections in the nematode worm which has exactly 302 neurons (compared to humans ~100 billion nuerons). Nemaload stands for nematode upload because the project seeks to eventually "upload" the nematode's mind to a digital form. Uploading the nematode's mind would preserve the worm as immortal as a digital entity. Further, if we could understand and fully model how a basic nematode worm's mind works, then modeling "a zebra fish, then a fruit fly, then a honeybee, then a mouse, then a dog, then a macaque monkey" and possibly eventually a human's mind would be just a matter of time. On the Nemaload site there is a section entitled "What's the point?" in which the ideologies which the Nemaload project subscribes to are provided.  Nemaload in prescribing a scientific ideology states that the progression of neuroscience and data-driven modeling are two primary goals. 
    %p While Nemaload embraces scientific ideology, it also embraces a particular philosophical ideology of the mind: functionalism.  Functionalism is the philosophical ideology that "if one has reproduced with a sufficient level of accuracy the computational function of a mind, then one has, in fact reproduced the mind." Assuming this philosophical ideology is essential for the Nemaload project because it aims to "scientifically" replicate the mind to a digital entity. Replicating the mind to a digital entity is only possible in so far as a "functional" representation would allow.  The functionalism ideology which Nemaload embraces is noted additionally to "inspire ethicists, philosophers, economics, sociologists and other humanities thinkers to take human uploading more seriously". If Nemaload were successful it is imaginable that human minds would be able to be stored as digital files. While this goal would be an incredible achievement through the utilization of "scientific" methodology, it is only facilitated through the latent philosophical ideological assumption of functionalism. As such, we see in the case of Nemaload, science as an ideology is inspired through the employment of functionalism as an ideology.  Epistemic anarchistic activity encouraged in Nemaload is influenced by numerous ideologies of which science borrows from philosophy.
    %p Nemaload labels itself not simply as a "science" project but as an "an antidisplinary, non-institutional science and technology project" because its author recognize it doesn't fit neatly within categorization. Although Nemaload is not a university-backed project or a startup, it still bills itself as being partially "science". The Nemaload project states that it is not attempting to be a "new way" of doing science, but rather simply that the direction of science has shifted in "modern America" such that it is unusual that science is done outside of a university. The Nemaload site states scientists were once "backed by private patrons centuries ago". Nemaload realizes that science likely has un-intentional connotation and it recognizes science as an ideology it employs in the scope of its larger epistemological project. 

    %h2 II.II. Soylent: The Uber Drink to Replace All Foods
    %p Robert Rhinehart decided he wanted a "quantified" and simpler way to get the nutrients his body needed for a healthy diet. After researching in depth all the necessary substances he believed his body needed to survive, Robert prepared the first 'Soylent' drink. Self-taught, Robert has been drinking and living on Soylent for 3 months with various results. He report overall he is healthier and he has been identifying deficiencies in Soylent and solving them along the way. Three months into living on Soylent, Robert found he was having joint pain, fit the symptoms of sulfur deiciency, and added more sulfur to Soylent. Using himself as a ginie pig, Robert has been employing scientific ideology in the development of Soylent. However, scientific ideology is not the only ideology Robert has utilized. In Robert's blog he states his own personal ideology in regards to how he views society:
    %blockquote
      We no longer live in a hunter-gather society. I have no use for bulging bicepts.... We need creativity, patience, displine, and humility. If people had more self-control obseity would take care of itself... Practically everything has gotten better over the past century but food has gotten worse. Thi sis because food is a haven for reactionaries. Reductionism is not romantic, but everything can be improve once seen as a sum of its parts..... In the past food was about survival. Now we can try to create something ideal.
    %p Soylent, like Nemaload is non-institionalized scientific project, but its creator has ideology that far exceeds the scopes of what science or method might dictate. Robert urges for reductionism in regards to how we view our nutrient input. Reductionism is a ideological idea that we should reduce, reduce, and reduce until we understand the most fundamental components of a thing. As Soylent is refined by Robert he employs scientific ideology through methodology through his refinement procedure however he has grander idealistic notions of what his epistmeic project entails. Soylent is a political tool just as much science project. Soylent employs reductionism in nutrient consumption.

    %h2 IV. Objection: Epistemological Anarchism is Self-Defeating
    %p Epistemological anarchism calls for methodological pluralism in epistemic activity. The overaching idea is that "anything goes" and thus ideologies can thus be limiting. Epistemological Anarchism because of its anarchistic stand might be accused of being self-defating as illustrated below:
    %ol
      %li Epistemological Anarchism asserts all ideologies should be employed.
      %li Thus: Epistemological anarchism is not justified.

    %p Epistemological anarachism 
    %p It is true that epistemological anarchism works within a philosophical ideology of sorts. Considering that Feyerabend asserts that there is "no, according to 
    
    however, it is meant to be used in the field emperically. 

    %p The best epistemological anarchist would likely not be an epistemological anarchist at all. As such, the theory of epistemological anarchy is 

    %p Adherence to specific methodology or sets of principles in epistemic activity ultimatly serves to inhibit progress.
    %p Epistemological anarchism would likely be interested in seeing the abolishment of all institutionalized science. As much as epistemological anarchy asserts that science should be a f
