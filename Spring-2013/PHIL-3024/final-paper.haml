    %p If I were to pose to you the question: what is science? You could give many different replies to this question. A neceessary and sufficient descriptive analysis of what "science" would be ideal. If you had such an analysis, you would also be able to answer of me the question:  what is not science?  These analyses exist, however the question I pose and wish to explore is why? Digging into why these analyses exist leads us to contemplate science's role in society as a whole. 

    Building on top of Feyerbend's notion of episteomological anarchism, I will set out to argue that the Internet serves as an epistemological anarchist's playground; enabling a broader notion of "science" than is afforded by traditional standards.

    %h2 I. Classical Noitions of the Demarcation of Science
    %p Karl Popper, a famous philosopher and friend of science, posited that the most critical problem within the philosophy of science is creating a "demarcation" criteria for science. A "demarcation" criteria would help distinguish science from non-science and psuedo-science. Such a crtieria would enable us to deem certain activities and theories as non-scientic or psuedo-scientific while reserving a space for true "scientific" theories. The scope and reach of such a criteria would be wide. It is sometimes argued that only "scientific" theories should be taught in formal education and schooling, such a criteria would thus  provide us with a solid grounding. Theories of intelligent design would finally be ruled unscientific and it would be appropriate to teach evolution in schools.

    %p What would a demaraction criteria look like though? How could we aim to gauge certain activities as being scientific and others as not? What are the features of sceintific practice that make it unique and distinguish it from all other practice? To this question philosophers of science have given many different replies over time. I will cover some of the more popularly argued for demaraction critereon. My list is not exhaustive but rather merely serves to illustrate that providing a criteria is not a trivial task.

    %h2 Science as an Activity
    %p One critically defining feature often argued as distinguishing science from non-science is that of <i>methodology</i>. Methodology is important because it can be said you are only doing science if there is a defined <i>scientific method</i> which you follow. Methodologies vary quite a bit, however, the most familiar notions when considering the practice of science in regards to methodology involve two particular features: verifiability and falsifiability. 

    %p Verifiability or reproducibility is a feature of the scientific process in which the results you have obtained from a given experiment can be <i>reproduced or verified</i> independent of the experimenter. As such if experimenter A uses B design and receives C results. It should be said that another experimenter, A1, using B design will receive C results as well. Verifiability is an underlying and essential component of what is often contorted as 

    %p Falsifiability is the notion in science that any given theory should be able to be falsified or proven wrong. If someone were to assert 

    eis that of verifiability. Verifiability is the criteria by which a given 
    
    we may consider is that of verifiability. Verifiability is the attribute of scientific practice that any given practi

    %p The first step in showing how the Internet enables a broader notion of what "science" is, is to analyze previous conceptions of science. The main question of interest going forth will be where is the line between science and non-science. Karl Popper posited that scienctific theories had the key feature of being falsifiable. This criteria for demarcation asserts that in order for a theory to be "scientific" it must at very least be able to be proven wrong, or falsified. As such if some theory A posits that b, an opposing scientific theory in relation to A should posit that not B and furhter go on to explain more. 

    %h2 Science's Place in Society
    %p Speaking epistemologically, the knowledge that science provides us with is no different from any other type of knowledge. Science does not offer us any "facts" about the world. Rather, science merely provides us with theories contingent upon other theories. Certain theories may become widely accepted and thus be prevelentally regarded as being "true". However, the "truth" that any given theory may provide is solely in virtue of its explanatory power in contrast to other less explanatory theories.
