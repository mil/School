    #title Epistemological Anarchism's Scientific Ideology Applied to the Internet
    %p Epistemological Anarchism is a theory within the philosophy of science that asserts that there are no specific methodological rules that progress science or grow our epistemic knowledge. The phrase "anything goes", as offered by epistemological anarchism's biggest proponent, Paul Feyerabend, captures this essence.  Epistemological anarchism does not assert that science's methodology is flawed, but rather that science is one of numerous ideologies that may contribute to any given epistemic project. Likening science to an ideology in line with mythology or religion is an essential piece of epistemological anarchism.  Epistemological anarchism notes that adherence to any specific ideology or methodology in epistemic activity will ultimately serve to inhibit progress by specifying ends to which means sought out.  Thus, Epistemological Anarchy calls for methodological pluralism in which all ideologies are embraced in epistemic activity.  The Internet provides an interesting vehicle for understanding epistemological anarchism's sense of methodological pluralism because the Internet can be understood as an epistemic "anything goes" environment.  Accepting epistemological anarchism, epistemic activity facilitated through the Internet can be seen to exhibit scientific ideology though not in isolation, but along side numerous among other ideologies.
    %p Overview aside, I will now provide a brief roadmap of my application of epistemological anarchism to the Internet. In (I), I will explore some of the primary motivations for epistemological anarchism advocating the likening of science to an ideology. Proceeding in (II), I will offer my argument construing the Internet as a facility for understanding epistemological anarchism. In (III), I will present paradigmatic examples of epistemological projects on the Internet incorporating scientific along with other ideologies. Concluding in (IV), I will refute an intuitive potential counter-argumentation to epistemological anarchism.

    %h2 I. Motivations for Epistemological Anarchism
    %p  Epistemological anarchism calls for a level playing ground for all ideologies employed in epistemic activity. As such, Epistemological Anarchism argues that science has an undeserved status in society as an ideology by questioning the implicit assumption that scientific knowledge is of higher quality merit than non-scientific knowledge.  Following I will illustrate how this assumption may be denied in light of: 1) an argument Feyerabend provides in "How to Defend Society Against Science" and 2) my own argument concerning the regress argument to disprove scientific theories could be in any sense realist.

    %h2 I.<sub>I</sub> Feyerabend's Argument in <i>How to Defend Society Against Science</i>
    %p Science is often viewed as a central epistemological entity in virtue of the notion that science has an isolatable method that delivers us results. In <i>How to Defend Society Against Science</i>, Paul Feyerabend shows mistaken this line of reasoning by critiquing the following argument: 
    %ol
      %li Science has finally found the correct method for achieving results.
      %li There are many results to prove the excellence of the method.
      %li <i>Thus</i>: The knowledge we receive from science is of higher quality merit than non-scientific knowledge.
    %p Feyerabend points out that if we grant (1) and assume specific "scientific" methodologies could be defined and agreed upon, such result-producing methodologies will always be fated to the problem of induction. Consider one example methodology by which science may be postulated to operate by which "science works by collecting facts and inferring theories from them" (Feyerabend, 183). In this methodology, can it ever be said that theories logically <i>follow</i> from facts? Suppose one white swan passes by, then another white swan passes by, and then a third white swan passes by. At what point can we infer all swans are white? At what point can we extrapolate from our experience to establish universal rules? To establish such universal rules, we must assume that the world works in a regular fashion. This is the classical problem of induction that will dictate that we cannot determine "logical facts" via science but merely observe and take note of contingent knowledge.  It follows that scientific methodology cannot provide us with answers to "how the world is" but rather scientific methodology can only ever provide us answers to "how the world has been so far".
    %p Feyerabend next rejects (2) in arguing that (2) may only be granted <i>if it is the case</i> that "nothing else has ever produced results" (Feyerabend, 186).  As such, any un-scientific methodology producing results would serve to disprove the excellence of science's results. To illustrate this point, consider a religious people performing a rain dance who have specific cultural rules and ceremony governing the methodological execution of the rain dance. Perhaps sometimes it rains and sometimes it does not rain when the rain dance is performed. The religious people's rain dance methodology produces results just as meteorologists calculating the density of the clouds, researching the atmosphere, and predicting when it will rain via scientific methodologies produces results.  Now, it is imaginable that the religious people methodology may more "accurately" predict the rain then the meteorologists due to numerous factors. Perhaps the meteorologists simply do not have the "ideal" theories formulated and as such less accurately predict the rain then the religious people.  Does this make the religious peoples methodology "better" or "more scientific" than the meteorologists? No, not necessarily; the point is the activities the meteorologists and the activities the religious people engage in are not so different. Scientific methodology delivering results is no different from any other methodology delivering results. Sometimes scientific methodology delivers "better" results than "un-scientific" methodology and sometimes visa-versa. Results simply cannot prove the excellence of a method so long as there exist other methods that produce results.
    %p However, even if (2) were to be assumed to be true and science's methodology was proven excellent in virtue of its results, said results would only prove scientific methodology's excellence in so far as it were <i>only</i> scientific methodology that were responsible for the results. Isolating specific "scientific methodology" seems like a difficult endeavor and further pulling upon the history of science this is an unsound assumption to grant. A rigid scientific method by which scientists follow "set" methods without incorporating "non-scientific" thought is an ideal of hardheaded scientific idealists. Feyerabend references the example from the history of science of when Copernicus introduced his view of the universe he did not reference previous scientific theories alone. Rather, Copernicus consulted "a crazy Pythagorean such as Philolaos" (Feyerabend, 186). It is highly questionable whether specific scientific methodology could be "isolated" since a the fullest specification of a "scientific method" would need specify all inference taken surrounding the practice of science including: the activities the scientist engages in when his day ends, returns home, eats dinner, non-scientifically has interactions with his wife, sleeps, dreams, and so on. Are all these activities part of the "scientific method" and where is the line to be drawn between what is science and what is not science? 
    %p Science attempting to compartmentalize its method for which results are delivered is a flawed notion. The scientific method does not aim to capture all activity that is experienced in science and the scientists' lives and as such "the scientific method" cannot be isolated. It follows that Feyerabend asserts that science should be liked to an ideology in lines with mythology, religion, or culture. Additionally, Feyerabend notes that science is merely one of many ideologies that play into epistemic activity. Methodological pluralism, encouraged by epistemological anarchism, does not want to discredit the value that science brings to the table; but rather merely recognize scientific ideology as one part in context of wider epistemic activity.

    %h2 I.<sub>II</sub> Against Realism, Justification, and Scientific Theories
    %p  Realism is the concept that there is an objective and shared reality that the world exhibits.  Science as a whole presupposes such a sense of realism regarding the observation of descriptive phenomena in our world. The scientific method calls for a descriptive, repeatable, and testable analysis grounded on the assumption of realism.  When a man drops a pen, it falls through the air, and hits the ground, we then suppose that in realist nature such reality was indeed shared between those watching the pen fall. However, science additionally takes a step outside of the observation of descriptive phenomena to justify <i>why</i> the pen fell through the air and hit the ground. To get at such justification, science abstracts theoretical entities such as gravity. To such theoretical entities in science, we extend our presupposition of realism that there is an objective shared reality for theories as well as observable phenomena. But how could we postulate theoretical entities as being real in the same way observable phenomena are?  To this notion of proving a "real" nature of theoretical entities, science seeks justification.
    %p Thus, if science aims to explain in theoretical concepts how the world really is then it need be able to <i>justify </i> its theoretical entities. Theoretical entities may only be true or real in virtue of their justification because they are <i>not</i> directly observable phenomena. So how might science provide justification for theoretical entities?  To explore this line of inquiry, first we must understand how knowledge is composed at its base level. The commonly asserted descriptive analysis of knowledge within epistemology is known as the Justified True Belief (JTB) analysis of knowledge. JTB asserts that in order for some subject, S, to know some proposition, P, two criterion must be fulfilled:
    %ol
      %li S is justified in believing that P is true
      %li S's belief in P is true
    %p Within epistemology, the regress problem arises from the JTB analysis of knowledge. The regress problem shows that defining knowledge in context to justification results in an ad-infinitum regress of justified true beliefs. Consider the following illustration of the regress problem:
    %ol
      %li A, B, and C are justified true beliefs 
      %li A is justified by B
      %li B is justified by C
      %li C must be justified by another justified true belief
      %li ...A regress of justified true beliefs continues on ad-infinitum since something we may be said to <i>know</i> must be always justified.
    %p A number of "solutions" to the regress problem have been proposed by epistemologists which all largely fall into one of two categories: foundationalism and coherentism.  Foundationalism asserts that all epistemological knowledge is grounded in "basic" or "foundational" beliefs. These "basic" beliefs are a-priori or self-justified such that the JTB criteria for knowledge does not apply at the "bedrock" of our epistemology. Cognitive giveness is one example of a criteria of a "basic" belief argued by foundationalists as self-justifying the bedrock of our knowledge. For example, if a subject observed a red door and formed the belief "the door is red", it would seem absurd to provide further justification to such belief. The belief "the door is red" might be classified as "cognitively given" by the foundationalist and need no further justification. An alternative to the foundationalism, coherentism solves the regress problem by asserting that all JTBs exist within a coherent system of beliefs and the linear style justification assumed by the regress problem is flawed. As such, depending your context and flavor of coherentism, the regress problem is largely viewed as nothing more than a pseudo-problem. For the coherentist, seeing a red door and forming the belief "the door is red" might be part of a much larger and grander set of "coherent" beliefs involving beliefs about: the color red, the subject's mental disposition, the concept of a door, and so on and so forth. Coherentism can be likened to a holistic or Gestaltic view of justification in which justification and knowledge may not always be exposed descriptively at face value but part of a bigger system.
    %p Infinitism is an anti-solution to the regress problem which denies any sort of realism in justification. Infinitism recognizes that justification does indeed result in an ad-infinitum series of justified true beliefs. Rather than viewing this ad-infinitum regress as a problem, the regress problem and its "solutions" can be seen as pointing at something very interesting about human reasoning.  Human reasoning is fundamentally anti-realist; not realist. Returning to the example of the red door, imagine two men in a room with a red door and one of the men asserts the proposition "the door is red". The other man in the room can either agree or disagree with the proposition at hand. Perhaps the man disagrees that the door is red and then provides reasons why he holds his view as such. Contrarily, perhaps the man accepts the proposition and then provides reasons for his acceptance. In either case, from an outside, observational, or realist perspective we cannot use our <i>reason</i> to understand why the external epistemic agent accepted or denied the claim objectively. Why does one man think one way and another think another way? What is the method for determining the answer to this question or how can we extrapolate <i>others</i> justification? Or to simplify: how can we <i>ground</i> justification? To any given proposition in language we can always inquire more justification simply by asking the question "why?". As such, there is no end to human reasoning justification; justification is simply an infinite regress with no foundation.
    %p Returning to science, theoretical entities may only "exist" in a realist sense in virtue of their <i>justification</i>. Given that our justification is fundamentally ungrounded provided the infinite regress of reasons seen in infinitism, how could science assert there to be <i>method</i> to determine the real nature theoretical entities in the world?  Asserting that there is a realist method to determine the nature of theoretical entities and provide objective reasons for their justification is just about as absurd as asserting that we could fathom <i>the</i> solution to the regress problem. So long as human beings have the capacity to question and thus disagree with one another, seeking <i>the</i> method for determining the nature of world entities is un-imaginable.  In conclusion, science's presupposition of a realist notion of the world is flawed. As such, science may merely provide nothing more than non-realist ideology of methodology in our exploration of the world.

    %h2 II. Argument: Science is Part of Epistemological Anarchistic Practice on the Internet
    %p With my epistemological anarchistic reasons for the likening of science to an ideology established in (I), it is appropriate to introduce my central argument. Modestly, I will argue that scientific ideology is part of epistemological anarchist practice on the Internet. When I refer to the Internet I am simply referring to the notion of an un-regulated, open forum for the publication of epistemic activity. My central argument is as follows:
    %ol
      %li Epistemological anarchistic activity consists of any and all epistemic activity. (Anything Goes)
      %li Science is one <i>ideology</i> among many others that may be employed in epistemological anarchistic activity.
      %li The Internet consists of publications of epistemic activity.
      %li <i>Thus</i>: Scientific ideology is part of epistemological anarchistic practice on the Internet.

    %h2 III. Epistemological Anarchistic Internet Projects Incorporating Scientific Ideology
    %p Proceeding I will add support for my argument outlined in (II) asserting that scientific ideology is part of epistemological anarchistic practice on the Internet.  Following I will look at two epistemic projects facilitated through the Internet which embrace science as an ideology. These projects should not be viewed as merely "science" projects but rather as more broad epistemic projects in lines with epistemological anarchism. Science's place in epistemological projects is not as the sole driving force, but rather science is one of many ideologies that can be seen as encouraged in any given epistemological project.

    %h2 III.<sub>I</sub> Nemaload: Digitally Replicating the Nematode's Mind
    %p Nemaload is a project which seeks to digitally replicate the function of the mind in the simplest possible nervous system. The simplest possible nervous system to look at is the neural connections in the nematode worm which has only 302 neurons. Nemaload stands for nematode upload because the project seeks to eventually "upload" the nematode's mind to a digital form. Uploading the nematode's mind would preserve the worm as immortal as a digital entity. Further, if we could understand and fully model how a basic nematode worm's mind works, then modeling "a zebra fish, then a fruit fly, then a honeybee, then a mouse, then a dog, then a macaque monkey" and possibly eventually a human's mind would be just a matter of time. On the Nemaload site there is a section entitled "What's the point?" in which the ideologies which the Nemaload project subscribes to are provided.  Nemaload in prescribing a scientific ideology states that the progression of neuroscience and data-driven modeling are two primary goals. 
    %p While Nemaload embraces scientific ideology, it also embraces a particular philosophical ideology of the mind: functionalism.  Functionalism is the philosophical ideology that "if one has reproduced with a sufficient level of accuracy the computational function of a mind, then one has, in fact reproduced the mind." Assuming this philosophical ideology is essential for the Nemaload project because Nemaload aims to "scientifically" replicate the mind to a digital entity. Replicating the mind to a digital entity is only possible in so far as a "functional" representation would permit.  The functionalism ideology which Nemaload embraces is noted additionally to serve to "inspire ethicists, philosophers, economics, sociologists and other humanities thinkers to take human uploading more seriously". If Nemaload were successful it is imaginable that human minds would be able to be stored as digital files. While this goal would be an incredible achievement through the utilization of scientific methodology as ideology, it would only be facilitated through the additional philosophical ideological assumption of functionalism. As such, we see in the case of Nemaload, science as an ideology is inspired through the employment of functionalism ideology.  Epistemic anarchistic activity encouraged in Nemaload is influenced by numerous ideologies of which in this case science borrows from philosophy.
    %p Nemaload labels itself not simply as a "science" project but as an "an antidisplinary, non-institutional science and technology project" because its author recognizes it doesn't fit neatly within categorization or institutionalization. Although Nemaload is not a university-backed project or a startup, it still bills itself as being partially "science". The Nemaload project states that it is not attempting to be a "new way" of doing science, but rather simply that the direction of science has shifted in "modern America" such that it is unusual that science is done outside of a university. The Nemaload site states scientists were once "backed by private patrons centuries ago". Nemaload realizes that science likely has un-intentional connotation and it recognizes science not on a pedestal as the great and driving force of its epistemic project. Rather, Nemaload recognizes that science is as an ideology it need employ in the scope of its larger epistemological project influenced by a number of different ideologies.

    %h2 III.<sub>II</sub> Soylent: The Uber Drink to Replace All Foods
    %p Robert Rhinehart, a self-taught dietician, decided he wanted a "quantified" and simpler way to get the nutrients his body needed for a healthy diet. After researching in depth all the necessary substances he believed his body needed to survive, Robert prepared the first 'Soylent' drink. Robert has been drinking and living on Soylent for 3 months with mixed although largely fruitful results. He reports overall he is healthier and along the way he has been identifying deficiencies in Soylent and solving them as they come. For examples, at one point along the way, Robert found he was having joint pain, discovered he fit the symptoms of sulfur deficiency, and added more sulfur to Soylent. Using himself as a guinea pig, Robert has been employing scientific ideology in the development of Soylent. However, scientific ideology is not the only ideology Robert has utilized. In Robert's blog he states his own personal ideology in regards to his societal disposition:
    %blockquote
      "We no longer live in a hunter-gather society. I have no use for bulging biceps.... We need creativity, patience, discipline, and humility. If people had more self-control obesity would take care of itself... Practically everything has gotten better over the past century but food has gotten worse. This is because food is a haven for reactionaries. Reductionism is not romantic, but everything can be improved once seen as a sum of its parts..... In the past food was about survival. Now we can try to create something ideal."
    %p Soylent, like Nemaload is a non-institutionalized scientific project, but its creator has ideology that far exceeds the scopes of what scientific ideology might entail. The core reason for Robert employing scientific ideology is motivated by his own reductionist ideology in regards to how we view our nutrient input. Reductionism is the philosophical ideology idea that we should reduce until we understand the most fundamental components of any given thing to see how the parts make the whole. As Soylent is refined by Robert he employs scientific ideology through his refinement procedure however he has grander idealistic notions of what his epistemic project entails. Robert in his own ideology sees societal problems and pleas for creativity and humility. These are not scientific ideological notions but his own personal ideological wants that feed into his larger epistemological anarchist project alongside his application of scientific ideology.

    %h2 IV. Objection: Epistemological Anarchism is Self-Defeating
    %p Epistemological anarchism calls for methodological pluralism in epistemic activity. The overarching idea is that "anything goes" and thus attention to particular ideologies in epistemic activity is limiting. The "anything goes" disposition which Epistemological Anarchism embraces might be employed to argue that Epistemological Anarchism is self-defeating as such:
    %ol
      %li Epistemological Anarchism denies the superiority of any ideology to progress knowledge.
      %li Epistemological Anarchism is an ideology.
      %li Thus: Epistemological Anarchism should not be accepted as it doesn't progress our epistemic knowledge.
    %p It is true that epistemological anarchism argues that no ideology progresses our epistemic knowledge at a superior rate. In this line of reasoning, the hardheaded acceptance and pursuit of "epistemological anarchism" in isolation would not be beneficial for any given epistemological project. As such, it is a very intuitive inference to simply disregard epistemological anarchism in a way as being self-defeating. However, someone raising this objection <i>misses</i> the point of epistemological anarchism. Epistemological anarchism does not assert that <i>no</i> ideologies should be employed in epistemic projects, but rather that <i>all</i> ideologies should be employed.  Just as science as an ideology may be employed in epistemic projects, epistemological anarchism could be seen as an ideology to be employed in epistemic projects. "Anything goes" stands for the incorporation of any and all ideologies in epistemic activity. Epistemological anarchism simply wishes to level the epistemological playground; not to exclude, ignore, or devalue any ideologies, methods, or epistemic practices.
